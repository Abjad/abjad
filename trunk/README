Abjad is an interactive software system designed to help composers 
build up complex pieces of music notation in an iterative and incremental way. 

    *   Use Abjad to create a symbolic representation of all the notes, 
        rests, staves, tuplets, beams and slurs in any score.

    *   Because Abjad extends the Python programming language, you can 
        use Abjad to make systematic changes to your music as you work.

    *   And because Abjad wraps the powerful LilyPond music notation package,
        you can use Abjad to control the typographic details of the symbols on the page.
