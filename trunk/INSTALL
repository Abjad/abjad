Installation
============

This install file refers to the 2.x releases of Abjad.


Dependencies
------------

Abjad depends on the following programs:

    * Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7
    * LilyPond 2.12 or newer

For Abjad to install and run properly, you must already have both Python 2.5 
(or Python 2.6 or Python 2.7) and LilyPond installed in your computer.

Note that Abjad does not yet support Python 3.0 or greater.

Also, make sure that both LilyPond and Python are in your PATH.

To test this simply type ...

    lilypond --version

... and then ...

    python --version

... at your command prompt. 

If both programs run then you are good to go.

Otherwise you'll have to add the location of the executables to your PATH.

You can find Python here: http://www.python.org

You can find LilyPond here: http://www.lilypond.org


Installing the latest prebuilt version of Abjad
-----------------------------------------------

If you have setuptools installed, simply type ...

    sudo easy_install -U abjad

... in the command prompt of your terminal window.

Python will install the latest prebuilt version of Abjad 
in the site packages directory on your computer and 
this will complete your installation of Abjad.

Otherwise, follow these manual install instructions:

1.  Download the latest release from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Abjad.

2.  Untar the downloaded file. For example ...

        tar xzvf Abjad-NNN.tar.gz
    
    ... where NNN is the version number of the latest release.

3.  Change into the directory created in step 2 with ...

        cd Abjad-NNN

    ... or equivalent.

4.  If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, 
    enter the command ...

        sudo python setup.py install

    ... at your command prompt.

5.  If you're using Windows, start up a command shell with administrator
    privileges and run the command ...

        setup.py install

    ... at your comamnd prompt.

These commands will cause Python to install Abjad in your site packages directory.


Note for Linux users
--------------------

Abjad defaults to xdg-open to display PDF files using your default PDF viewer.
Most Linux distributions now come with xdg-utils installed.

If you do not have xdg-utils installed, you can download it from 
http://www.portland.freedsektop.org and install it.

Alternatively you can set the pdfviewer variable in the $HOME/.abjad/config file 
to your favorite PDF viewer.
