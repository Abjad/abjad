Thank you for downloading Abjad!

To install Abjad you must already have Python 2.5 or Python 2.6 installed in your computer. 


Installing the official release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. Download the latest release from http://www.projectabjad.org.

    2. Untar the downloaded file (e.g. ``tar xzvf Abjad-NNN.tar.gz``,
       where ``NNN`` is the version number of the latest release).

    3. Change into the directory created in step 2 (e.g. ``cd Abjad-NNN``).

    4. If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter
       the command ``sudo python setup.py install`` at the shell prompt.
       If you're using Windows, start up a command shell with administrator
       privileges and run the command ``setup.py install``.

These commands will install Abjad in your Python installation's `site-packages` directory. Note that this requires a working internet connection if you don't already have the Python utility "setuptools" installed.


Installing the development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you'd like to be at the cutting edge of the Abjad development use the following alternative:

   1. Install Subversion if you don't have it already installed 
      (enter 'svn help' to verify this).

   2. Check out Abjad's 'trunck' development like so:

         svn co svn://128.59.116.55/abjad/trunk/ abjad-trunk

   3. Make the Python interpreter aware of Abjad. There are two ways to do
      this:
         a) Make a symlink in your Python 'site-packages' directory pointing
            to the abjad-trunk directory previously checked out via Subversion:
               
               ln -s 'pwd'/abjad-trunk/abjad SITE-PACKAGES-DIR/abjad

            where SITE-PACKAGES-DIR is the Python 'site-packages' directory.
            In Linux this is usually in /usr/lib/Python2.x/site-packages.

         b) Alternatively you can include the 'abjad-trunk' directory in 
            your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
