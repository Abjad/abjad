<h2>Creating Rests</h2>

<p>
The Abjad <code>Rest</code> initializes with a duration value only.
</p>

<pre>
  abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
  abjad> rest
  Rest(4)
  abjad> show(rest)
</pre>

<h2><code>Rest</code> specific attributes</h2>
<p>
In addition to the attributes inherited from the <code>_Leaf</code> class (such as <strong>duration</strong>, <strong>grace</strong>, etc.), the <code>Rest</code> class also possesses a <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
This may seem strange given that Rests represent the absence of sound. 
However, as a glyph in a score, Rests also necessarily have a vertical position relative to the Staff. 
By default the vertical position of rests is set automatically by the LilyPond renderer, but it can be set arbitrarily with the <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
</p>
<pre>
  abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
  abjad> rest.pitch = -1
  abjad> show(rest)
</pre>
<p>
Notice how the position of the rest is here moved down so it falls exactly on B<sub>3</sub>. 
</p>
<p>
To remove the pitch from a <code>Rest</code> simply set the attribute to None.
</p>
<pre>
  abjad> rest.pitch = None
</pre>
