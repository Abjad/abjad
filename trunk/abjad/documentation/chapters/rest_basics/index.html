<h1> Working with rests </h1>

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Creating rests </h2><p> Create rests with any <code><a href="../duration_token/index.html">duration token</a></code>.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
</pre>

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Changing duration </h2><p> Change rest duration by direct assignment.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
</pre>
<img src="images/2.png">
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest.duration = (3, 16)
</pre>
<img src="images/3.png">
<p> Any <code><a href="../duration_token/index.html">duration token</a></code> will work on the right-hand side of the assigment operator.

<h2> Using pitch as a vertical positioner </h2><p> In addition to the attributes inherited from the <code><a href="../leaf_class/index.html">_Leaf</a></code> class (such as <strong>duration</strong>, <strong>grace</strong>, etc.), the <code><a href="../rest_class/index.html">Rest</a></code> class also possesses a <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
This may seem strange given that rests represent the absence of sound. 
However, as a glyph in a score, rests also necessarily have a vertical position relative to the staff. 
By default the vertical position of rests is set automatically by the LilyPond renderer, but it can be set arbitrarily with the <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest.pitch = -1
</pre>
<img src="images/4.png">
<p> Notice how the position of the rest is here moved down so it falls exactly on B<sub>3</sub>. 
<p> To remove pitch from a rest, simply set pitch to None.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest.pitch = None
</pre>

<h2 class="page-section"> To do </h2>

<div class="to-do">

<p> The better way of setting vertical position in LilyPond is simply something like <code>\once \override Rest #'staff-position = #-6</code>, which sets <code>staff-position</code> explicitly on the LilyPond <code>Rest</code> grob. Notice, however, that Abjad currently affords no way to set LilyPond overrides on the <code>Rest</code> grob. The reason for this is that Abjad allows for automatic LilyPond overrides of only leaf <strong>interface</strong> and not of <strong>leaves themselves</strong>. So we should remedy this and allow for leaf overrides directly.
