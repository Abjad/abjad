See the <code>Container</code> class in <code>containers/container.py</code> for implementation details.

<p>
The Abjad <code>Measure</code> class implements the <strong>measure-as-container</strong> interpretation of measures, common in Classical and Romantic music.
The competing <strong>measure-as-picket</strong> interpretation understands the sequence of measures in the score not as a series of containers but as a backgrounded sequence of positions of vertical alignment instead.
This second, measure-as-picket scheme predominates contemporary transcriptions of medieval scores.
The measure-as-container scheme forbids <strong>barline cross</strong>;
the measure-as-picket scheme allows it.
The flexibility of measure-as-picket exceeds measure-as-container;
it is probably for this reason that LilyPond implements the former rather than the latter.
Abjad implements the measure-as-picket scheme in the Abjad <code>MetricGrid</code> spanner.

<to-do>

<p>
Add examples.
</p>

<p>
Implement an abstract <code>_TrimmedContainer</code> class from which both this class and <FixedDurationTuplet> can inherit.
