<h1>Multiplied duration</h1>

<p>
<!-- Abjad notes, rests, chords and skips take an optional <a href="../multipliers/index.html">leaf multiplier</a>.
Abjad defines the <strong>multiplied duration</strong> of notes, rests, chords and skips carrying a leaf multiplier equal to the product of <a href="../written_duration/index.html">written duration</a> and the value of the multiplier.

<p>
The first two notes here carry <a href="../leaf_multipliers/index.html">leaf mulitipliers</a> equal to <tt>2/1</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
  abjad> notes = Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4
  abjad> notes[0].duration.multiplier = (2, 1)
  abjad> notes[1].duration.multiplier = (2, 1)
  abjad> measure = Measure((3, 8), notes) 
  abjad> Beam(measure)
  abjad> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
  abjad> show(staff)
</pre>
<image class="inline" src="images/1.png">
<pre>
  abjad> note = measure[0]
  abjad> note.duration.written
  Rational(1, 16)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> note.duration.multiplier
  Rational(2, 1)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> note.duration.written * note.duration.multiplier
  Rational(1, 8)
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="../written_duration/index.html">written duration</a> of these first two notes equals <tt>1/16</tt> and so the multiplied duration of these first two notes equals <tt>1/16 * 2/1 = 1/8</tt>.

<p class="comment">
Abjad currently implements no explicit <code>duration.multiplied</code> attribute.
Would be easy to add such an attribute to the <code>_LeafDurationInterface</code>.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Only leaves carry multiplied duration.
Tuplets carry a multiplier but no multiplied duration.
Should we rename tuplet multipliers to something else like tuplet ratios?
</p>

<p class="comment">
The chapter here defines multiplied duration equal to <tt>written * multiplier</tt>.
We could define multiplied duration equal to <tt>written * multiplier * prolation</tt> instead.
But let's not.
</p>

<p class="comment">
We have no leaf duration attribute equal to <tt>multiplier * prolation</tt>.
This product shows what we might call the 'composite prolation' or 'total scaling' or 'gestalt scaling' directed towards the leaf in question.
I don't think we've ever needed such an attribute.
If we ever do it will be easy to add to <code>_LeafDurationInterface</code> once we come up with a one-word name for the attribute.
