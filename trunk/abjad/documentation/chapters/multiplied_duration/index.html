<p> The first two notes here carry <a href="../leaf_multipliers/index.html">leaf mulitipliers</a> equal to <tt>2/1</tt>.

<pre class="abjad">
abjad> notes = Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4
abjad> notes[0].duration.multiplier = (2, 1)
abjad> notes[1].duration.multiplier = (2, 1)

abjad> Beam(measure)

<p> The <a href="../written_duration/index.html">written duration</a> of these first two notes equals <tt>1/16</tt> and so the multiplied duration of these first two notes equals <tt>1/16 * 2/1 = 1/8</tt>.

<div class="comments">

<p> Abjad currently implements no explicit <code>duration.multiplied</code> attribute.
Would be easy to add such an attribute to the <code><a href="../leaf_duration_interface/index.html">_LeafDurationInterface</a></code>.

<p> Only leaves carry multiplied duration.
Tuplets carry a multiplier but no multiplied duration.
Should we rename tuplet multipliers to something else like tuplet ratios?

<p> The chapter here defines multiplied duration equal to <tt>written * multiplier</tt>.
We could define multiplied duration equal to <tt>written * multiplier * prolation</tt> instead.
But let's not.

<p> We have no leaf duration attribute equal to <tt>multiplier * prolation</tt>.
This product shows what we might call the 'composite prolation' or 'total scaling' or 'gestalt scaling' directed towards the leaf in question.
I don't think we've ever needed such an attribute.
If we ever do it will be easy to add to <code><a href="../leaf_duration_interface/index.html">_LeafDurationInterface</a></code> once we come up with a one-word name for the attribute.
