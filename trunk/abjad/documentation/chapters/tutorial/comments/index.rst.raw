Adding comments
===============

It is easy to add comments to any Abjad component.


Adding leaf comments
--------------------

You can add comments to any note, rest, chord or skip.

<abjad>
note = Note(13, (1, 4))
show(note)
write_ly(note, 'first-ex') <hide
</abjad>

::

   abjad> note.comments.before.append('This is a comment before the note.')
   abjad> note.comments.before.append('This is another comment before the note.')

::

   abjad> print note.format
   % This is a comment before the note.
   % This is another comment before the note.
   cs''4

Leaf comments go before, after or to the right of the note they modify.


Adding container comments
-------------------------

You can also add comments to any container.

<abjad>
staff = Staff(construct.scale(4))
show(staff)
write_ly(staff, 'staff-ex') <hide
</abjad>

::

   abjad> staff.comments.before.append('Here is a comment before the staff.')
   abjad> staff.comments.opening.append('Here is a comment in the staff opening.')
   abjad> staff.comments.opening.append('Here is another comment in the staff opening.')
   abjad> staff.comments.closing.append('Comment in the staff closing.')
   abjad> staff.comments.after.append('Comment after the staff.')

::

   abjad> print staff.format
   % Here is a comment before the staff.
   \new Staff {
           % Here is a comment in the staff opening.
           % Here is another comment in the staff opening.
           c'8
           d'8
           e'8
           f'8
           % Comment in the staff closing.
   }
   % Comment after the staff.

The complete set of container comment locations is ``before``, ``after``, 
``opening`` and ``closing``.


Removing comments
-----------------

Comment locations are all built-in Python lists.

This means you can add and remove comments with the usual list methods. ::

   abjad> staff.comments.before.pop( )
   abjad> 'Here is a comment before the staff.'
   abjad> staff.comment.opening.pop( )
   abjad> 'Here is another comment in the staff opening.'

::

   abjad> print staff.format
   \new Staff {
           % Here is a comment in the staff opening.
           c'8
           d'8
           e'8
           f'8
           % Comment in the staff closing.
   }
   % Comment after the staff.
