<h1> Pitch overview </h1>

<introduction>

<p> Abjad models pitch with a combination of custom classes and helper functions.

</introduction>

<subsection> Custom classes

<p> Abjad implements custom <code>Note</code>, <code>Chord</code>, <code>_NoteHead</code>, <code>Pitch</code> and <code>_Accidental</code> classes to model the way that notes and pitches work together.

</subsection>


<subsection> Helper functions

<p> Abjad implements a collection of helper functions to operate on pitch.

</subsection>

<subsection> Microtonality

<p> Abjad implements quartertones only.

<comments>

<p> The chapters here refer to both object-oriented Abjad classes and to the pitch-classes of American music theory.
This first use of 'class' refers to instantiable code and the second to the residue classes of a pitch space.

<p> For the conventions these chapters follow, refer to the appendix on <a href="../pitch_conventions/index.html">pitch conventions</a>.
