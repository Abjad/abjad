<h2 class="page-section"> Comments </h2>

<div class="comments">

<p> The chapters here refer to both object-oriented Abjad classes and to the pitch-classes of American music theory.
This first use of 'class' refers to instantiable code and the second to the residue classes of a pitch space.

<p> For the conventions these chapters follow, refer to the appendix on <a href="../pitch_conventions/index.html">pitch conventions</a>.
