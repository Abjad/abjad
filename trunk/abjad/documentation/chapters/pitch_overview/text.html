Abjad implements quartertones only.

<h2 class="end-of-page">Comments</h2>

<p class="comment">
The chapters here refer to both object-oriented Abjad classes and to the pitch-classes of American music theory.
This first use of 'class' refers to instantiable code and the second to the residue classes of a pitch space.
</p>

<p class="comment">
For the conventions these chapters follow, refer to the appendix on <a href="../pitch_conventions/index.html">pitch conventions</a>.
