<h1> Working with notes </h1>

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Creating notes </h2><p> Create notes with numeric pitch and duration indicators.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
</pre>
<img src="images/1.png">
</div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Changing note duration </h2><p> You can assign values directly to the note duration interface.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note.duration = (1, 8)
</pre>
<img src="images/2.png">
<p> You can use any duration token on the right-hand side of such an assignment.
</div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Duration comparisons </h2><p> Compare note durations with Python's equality operator.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> Note(0, (1, 8)) == Note(0, (3, 8))
False
</pre>
<p> Greater than, less than and the other comparison operators work as expected.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> Note(0, (1, 8)) < Note(0, (3, 8))
True
</pre>
<p> You can do all the normal things with the note duration interface that you can do with the other Abjad duration interfaces.
These include copying and rewriting.
</div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Working with note pitch </h2><p> You can assign pitches to a note a note in a couple of different ways.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note.pitch = 1
abjad> note
Note(cs', 4)
</pre>
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note.pitch = Pitch('d', 4)
abjad> note
Note(d', 4)
</pre>
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note.pitch = ('ds', 4)
abjad> note
Note(ds', 4)
</pre>
</div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Creating rests </h2><p> The Abjad <code><a href="../rest_class/index.html">Rest</a></code> initializes with a duration value only.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
abjad> rest
Rest(4)
abjad> show(rest)
</pre>
<img src="images/3.png">
</div class="subsection">

<div class="subsection">
<h2> Rest-specific attributes </h2><p> In addition to the attributes inherited from the <code><a href="../leaf_class/index.html">_Leaf</a></code> class (such as <strong>duration</strong>, <strong>grace</strong>, etc.), the <code><a href="../rest_class/index.html">Rest</a></code> class also possesses a <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
This may seem strange given that rests represent the absence of sound. 
However, as a glyph in a score, rests also necessarily have a vertical position relative to the staff. 
By default the vertical position of rests is set automatically by the LilyPond renderer, but it can be set arbitrarily with the <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
abjad> rest.pitch = -1
abjad> show(rest)
</pre>
<img src="images/4.png">
<p> Notice how the position of the rest is here moved down so it falls exactly on B<sub>3</sub>. 
<p> To remove the pitch from a <code>Rest</code> simply set the attribute to None.
<pre class="abjad">
abjad> rest.pitch = None
</pre>
