<div class="introduction">

<p> Read all the Abjad Fundamentals next.

These chapters explain the Leaf Container Spanner (LCS) Model on which Abjad is based.

These chapters also explain how to work with all the basic Abjad components, including notes, rests, chords and staves.

<p> Read some of the chapters concerning materials generation to figure out how to create starting materials.

<p> And then read about structure traversal and manipulation to learn how move around in large pieces of notation and change them while you go.

<p> The most powerful features of Abjad are the set of interlocking models that structure the system.

Find out how Abjad models pitch, duration, leaves and containers in the chapters on understanding the Abjad model.

<p> When you get stuck, read check out the public interface listings in the class definition chapters.

<p> And last, once as you start to add your own classes or helpers to Abjad, read the chapter about developer concerns.

We love contributions from composers working in many different ways. 

So get in touch and consider contributing to the project at any time.
