<h1>The core duration interface</h1>

<p>
The core duration interface implements three public attributes.
All three are read-only.
</p>

<ul>
   <li> <code>prolation</code>
   <li> <code>prolations</code>
   <li> <code>prolated</code>
</ul>

<p>
See the chapters on <a href="../prolation/index.html">prolation</a> and <a href="../prolated_duration/index.html">prolated duration</a>.
</p>

<p>
The core duration interface implements no public methods.
</p>

<p>
The core duration interface inherits from the Abjad <code>Rational</code> class.
This means that all Abjad duration interfaces afford the standard arithmetic operations, like addition, multiplication, exponentiation and comparison.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The core duration interface currently inherits from both <code>_Interface</code> and <code>Rational</code>.
Smarter will be to strip the multiple inheritence and leave the core duration interface to inherit from <code>_Interface</code> only.
This will greatly reduce the number of arithmetic operations which the different duration interfaces can undergo; and this is a good thing.
We want duration interfaces to afford comparison but not arithmetic.
This means that we will have to implement comparison on the core duration interface by hand after we remove <code>Rational</code> from the inheritance chain.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The classname of the core duration interface is <code>_DurationInterface</code>.The class implements in the <code>core/duration</code> module.
