<title> Duration types </title>

<h1>Duration types</h1>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>  </h2>
<p> Abjad publishes duration information about notes, rests, chords and skips, and also about tuplets, measures, voices, staves and the other containers.
Abjad groups duration information about notes, rests, chords and skips into the <code>_LeafDurationInterface</code> class; duration information about tuplets, measures, voices, staves and other containers groups together inside some type of container duration interface.
For information on the duration of notes, rests, chords and skips, see <a href="../working_with_leaf_durations/index.html">the chapter on working with leaf durations</a>; for information on the duration of tuplets, measures, voices, staves and other containers, see <a href="../working_with_container_durations/index.html">the chapter on working with container durations</a>.
This chapter lists all duration attributes, belonging to leaves, containers or both.

</div class="subsection">

<h2 class="page-section"> Written duration </h2>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>  </h2>
<p> Abjad notes, rests, chords and skips all make written duration available as <code>duraiton.written</code>.
Written duration is a user-assignable rational number.
Users can assign and reassign the written duration of notes, rests, chords and skips at initialization and at any time during the life of the note, rest, chord or skip.
Notes, rests, chords and skips admit a degree of input flexibility; Abjad <code>Rational</code> instances, rational tokens, and integers are all allowed; see the chapter on <a href="../duration_initialization/index.html">duration initialzation</a> for details.
Written durations must always be notehead-assignable; see the chapter on <a href="../notehead_assignability/index.html">notehead assignability</a> for details.
The written duration of notes, rests, chords and skips corresponds more closely to our usual understanding of musical duration than do any of the other Abjad duration attributes.
Abjad containers do not carry written duration.

<pre class="abjad">
abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
abjad> note.duration.written
Rational(1, 4)
</pre>

<h2 class="page-section"> Prolated duration </h2>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>  </h2>
<p> <a href="../prolation/index.html">Prolation</a> refers to the duration-scaling effects of tuplets and special types of time signature.
Prolation is a way of thinking about the contribution that <i>musical structure</i> makes to the duration of score objects.
All durated Abjad objects carry a prolated duration as <code>duration.prolated</code>.
Prolated duration is an emergent property of notes, tuplets and other durated objects.
The prolated duration of notes, rests, chords and skips equals the product of the written duration and prolation of those objects.
The prolated duration of tuplets, measures and other containers equals the product of the container duration interface itself and the prolation of the container in question.

</div class="subsection">

<h2 class="page-section"> To do </h2>

<div class="to-do">

<p> Prolated leaf duration makes perfect sense: written * prolation.
But prolated container duration is a mess: self * prolation, where self is whatever magic value the container duration interface itself carries.
Clean this in the one remaining duration rewrite.
We want <i>duration interface comparison</i> of the form <code>leaf1.duration == leaf2.duration</code> and <code>container1.duration == container2.duration</code>.
But we do <strong>not</strong> want <i>duration interface assignment</i> of the form <code>container1.duration = (1, 8)</code>.
Right now, unfortunately, fixed-duration tuplets demand interface assignment when, for example, you want to change the "container size" (or whatever it is) of the tuplet in question.
