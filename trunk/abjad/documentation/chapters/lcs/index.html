<h1>The Leaf Container Spanner (LCS) Model</h1>

<div class="subsection">

<p>
At the heart of Abjad's Symbolic Score-Control lies a powerful model that we call the Leaf Container Spanner, or LCS, model of the musical score.
Every objects in Abjad is either a Leaf, a Container or a Spanner.  
The type of each object is determined by it structural relationship within the score model. 
</p>

<p>
Leaves include notes, rests, chords and skips. 
Containers include staves, voices, measures and tuplets.
Spanners include beams, trills, ties, glissandi, and pedal markings, among others.
</p>

<p>
The LCS model can be schematically visualized as a superposition of two complementary and completely independent layers of structure: a <b>tree</b> that includes the Containers and the Leaves, and a layer of free floating "connectors" or Spanners.

<p>
There can be any number of Spanners, they may overlap, and they may "connect" to different levels of the tree hierarchy. 
The spanner attach to the elements of the tree, so a tree structure must exist for spanners to be made manifest.
