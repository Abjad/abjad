Leaf multipliers
================

LilyPond provides an asterisk `*` operator to scale the durations of
notes, rests, chords and skips by arbitrarily positive rational
values. LilyPond multipliers are inivisible and generate no
typographic output of their own. However, while independent from the
typographic output, LilyPond multipliers do factor in in calculations
of duration and time.

Abjad implements LilyPond multpliers as the settable
`duration.multiplier` attribute of notes, rests, chords and skips.

<abjad>
    abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
    abjad> note.duration.multiplier = Rational(1, 2)
    abjad> note.duration.multiplier
    Rational(1, 2)
</abjad>

<abjad>    
    abjad> print(note.format)
    c'4 * 1/2
</abjad>

Abjad also implements a `duration.multiplied` attribute to examine the
duration of a note, rest, chord or skip as affected by the multiplier
(see :class:`abjad._Leaf.duration._LeafDurationInterface` for all other duration attributes available).


<abjad>    
    abjad> note.duration.multiplied
    Rational(1, 8)
</abjad>    

LilyPond multipliers give the half notes here multiplied durations
equal to a quarter note.

<abjad>    
    abjad> notes = Note(0, (1, 4)) * 4
    abjad> multiplied_note = Note(0, (1, 2))
    abjad> multiplied_note.duration.multiplier = Rational(1, 2)
    abjad> multiplied_notes = multiplied_note * 4
    abjad> top = RhythmicStaff(notes)
    abjad> bottom = RhythmicStaff(multiplied_notes)
    abjad> staves = StaffGroup([top, bottom])
    hide> write(staves, 'example1', 'oedo')
</abjad>



.. note::

   Abjad models multiplication fundamentally differently than prolation .
   See the chapter on :doc:`../prolation/index` for more
   information.

.. note::

   The LilyPond multiplication `*` operator differs from the Abjad
   multiplication `*` operator. LilyPond multiplication scales duration
   of LilyPond notes, rests, chords and skips. Abjad multiplication
   copies Abjad containers and leaves.
