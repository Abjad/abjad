Introduction
============


Abjad publishes information about many durated score objects.

Notes, rests, chords and skips carry some duration attributes. ::

	abjad> note = Note(0, (3, 16))
	abjad> measure = RigidMeasure((3, 16), [note])
	abjad> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
	abjad> print note.duration.written
	3/16

Tuplets, measures, voices, staves and the other containers carry even more. ::

	abjad> tuplet = FixedDurationTuplet((3, 16), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 5)
	abjad> measure = RigidMeasure((3, 16), [tuplet])
	abjad> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
	abjad> print tuplet.duration.multiplier
	3/5

The next chapters document duration in Abjad and explain core duration concepts.
