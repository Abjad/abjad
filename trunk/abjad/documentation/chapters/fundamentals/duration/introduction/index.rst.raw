Introduction
============


Abjad publishes information about many **durated** score objects.

Notes, rests, chords and skips carry some duration attributes.

<abjad>
note = Note(0, (3, 16))
measure = RigidMeasure((3, 16), [note])
staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
print note.duration.written
write(staff, 'example1', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

Tuplets, measures, voices, staves and the other containers carry even more.

<abjad>
tuplet = FixedDurationTuplet((3, 16), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 5)
measure = RigidMeasure((3, 16), [tuplet])
staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
print tuplet.duration.multiplier
write(staff, 'example2', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

The next chapters document duration in Abjad and explain core duration concepts.
