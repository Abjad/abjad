Pitch token
===========


Abjad notes and chords accept all of the following as pitch input:

#. Python `int` and `long` instances
#. Python `float` instances
#. Abjad :class:`Pitch <abjad.NamedPitch.pitch.Pitch>` instances


For example:

<abjad>
note = Note(0, (1, 4))
measure = RigidMeasure((1, 4), [note]) <hide
measure.meter.transparent = True <hide
write(measure, 'pitch_token1', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

And:

<abjad>
note = Note(5.5, (1, 4))
measure = RigidMeasure((1, 4), [note]) <hide
measure.meter.transparent = True <hide
write(measure, 'pitch_token2', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

And:

<abjad>
note = Note(NamedPitch(13), (1, 4))
measure = RigidMeasure((1, 4), [note]) <hide
measure.meter.transparent = True <hide
write(measure, 'pitch_token3', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>


The Abjad **pitch token** generalizes these four types of input.

Examples in the documentation that ask for valid pitch token input accept any of the types of input show here.


.. note::

   Abjad accepts only those ``float`` instances evenly divisible by `0.5` as valid pitch token instances because Abjad implements accidental drawing symbols to the level of the quartertone only.
