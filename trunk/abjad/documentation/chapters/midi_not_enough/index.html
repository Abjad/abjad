<title>Why MIDI is not enough</title>

<h1>Why MIDI is not enough</h1>
<p>
Given that Abjad models written musical score, it might seem odd for MIDI to be even mentioned in this manual. 
Yet, until fairly recently, MIDI has played a role (sometimes tangential, other times fundamental) in a variety of software tools related to music notation and engraving.
</p>

<h2>A brief history of MIDI</h2>
<p>
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was first introduced in 1981 by Dave Smith, the founder of Sequential Circuits. 
The original purpose of MIDI was to allow the communication between different electronic musical instruments; more specifically, to allow one device to send <b>control</b> data to another device. Typical messages might be "note On" (play a <em>note</em>) "note Off" (turn off a <em>note</em>). <em>Note</em> in this context means something very different than <em>note</em> in a score. Since the first MIDI capable instruments where keyboard synthesizers (like the Prophet 600), in this early context <em>note</em> would more closely refer to <em>key</em>, or more generally "sound trigger number".   

<p>
With the subsequent popularity of music software development and consumption, the SMF (Standard Midi File) was introduced to allow the recording and storage of the control data from a MIDI stream. 
The SMF required a time stamp to keep track of when control messages took place. These are called "delta-times" in the SMF specification:
<q>The MTrk chunk type is where actual song data is stored. It is simply a stream of MIDI events (and non-MIDI events), preceded by delta-time values.</q>
