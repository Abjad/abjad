<h1>The Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class</h1>

<p>
The Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class models musical pitch.
</p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p>
The Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class is a public class that can instantiate at any time.
The usual way to instantiate <code>Pitch</code> objects is numerically with middle C equal to 0. 
Numbers greater than 0 give pitches higher than middle C; numbers less than 0 give pitches lower than middle C.
</p>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(-1)
  Pitch(b, 3)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(0)
  Pitch(c, 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(1)
  Pitch(cs, 4)
</pre>

<p>
Abjad represents as pitch-class / octave pairs to the interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Floating-point values initialize correctly.
And quartertones are possible with floats ending in <tt>.5</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(0.0)
  Pitch(c, 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(0.5)
  Pitch(cqs, 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(1.0)
  Pitch(cs, 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> Pitch(1.5)
  abjad> Pitch(dqf, 4)
</pre>

<h2>Accidental spelling</h2>

<p>
Does pitch number <tt>6</tt> instantiate as F&#9839;4 or as G&#9837;4? 
Pitch-classes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 notate without accidentals.
But a question remains as to what to do with the remaining pitch-classes.
By default, Abjad maps pitch-classes to accidentals acording to the following table.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
   <td> <tt>1</tt>
   <td> &rarr;
   <td> C&#9839;
<tr>
   <td> <tt>3</tt>
   <td> &rarr;
   <td> E&#9837;
<tr>
   <td> <tt>6</tt>
   <td> &rarr;
   <td> F&#9839;
<tr>
   <td> <tt>8</tt>
   <td> &rarr;
   <td> G&#9837;
<tr>
   <td> <tt>10</tt>
   <td> &rarr;
   <td> B&#9837;
</table>

<p>
Tonal music handles accidental spelling according to a system of keys.
Abjad uses the accidental resolution method describe here as a type of neutral spelling for nontonal musics.

<p class="comment">
Do not confuse the object-oriented use of 'class' to describe the Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class with the use of 'class' in American pitch-class theory.
The first refers to instantiable code, the second to the residue classes of a pitch space.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Abjad pitch specification with middle C equal to 0 follows the presentation of American pitch-class theory in, for example, Robert Morris's <i>Composition with Pitch-classes</i> (1978). IRCAM / MIDI pitch numbers equal Abjad pitch numbers plus 60.

<p class="comment">
Abjad allows integer and float pitch arguments only. Abjad does not allow pitch arguments of the form <code>Rational(3, 2)</code> or <code>(3, 2)</code>. Use <code>1.5</code> instead.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Abjad currently generates a <code>KeyError</code> for pitch arguments of the form <code>Rational(0, 2)</code> and <code>0.2</code> but should generate a custom exception instead.

<p class="comment">
Abjad assigns sharps to pitch-classes 1 and 6 and flats to pitch-classes 3, 8 and 10. There is currently no way to change this behavior at note-instantiation time. But it is easy to change the accidental of any notehead after instantiation. To-do: design and implement some way to allow different acciental-assignment behaviors at note-instantiation time. The first strategy that comes to mind is the creation of a new Abjad cfg variable that can change during runtime &mdash; all sharps before instantiating an upward chromatic run, all flats before a downward chromatic run, etc.

<p class="comment">
Abjad implements quartertones but none of the other types of microtone. LilyPond now makes arrowed accidentals available and support for those is on the Abjad to-do list.
</p>

<p class="comment">
LilyPond implements several different accidental handling methods.
Abjad outputs LilyPond input with no special indications for accidental handling.
Nontonal music may prefer to use the LilyPond <code>'forget</code> option for handling accidentals.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Do we have an Abjad-native way of setting <code>'forget</code>?
