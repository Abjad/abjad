<h1>The Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class</h1>

<p>
The Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class models musical pitch.
</p>

<p>
See the chapters on <a href="../pitch_conventions/index.html">pitch conventions</a> and <a href="../chapters/pitch_initialization/index.html">pitch initialization</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="end-of-page">Comments</h2>

<p class="comment">
Do not confuse the object-oriented use of 'class' to describe the Abjad <code>Pitch</code> class with the use of 'class' in American pitch-class theory.
The first refers to instantiable code, the second to the residue classes of a pitch space.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Abjad allows integer and float pitch arguments only. Abjad does not allow pitch arguments of the form <code>Rational(3, 2)</code> or <code>(3, 2)</code>. Use <code>1.5</code> instead.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Abjad currently generates a <code>KeyError</code> for pitch arguments of the form <code>Rational(0, 2)</code> and <code>0.2</code> but should generate a custom exception instead.

<p class="comment">
Abjad assigns sharps to pitch-classes 1 and 6 and flats to pitch-classes 3, 8 and 10. There is currently no way to change this behavior at note-instantiation time. But it is easy to change the accidental of any notehead after instantiation. To-do: design and implement some way to allow different acciental-assignment behaviors at note-instantiation time. The first strategy that comes to mind is the creation of a new Abjad cfg variable that can change during runtime &mdash; all sharps before instantiating an upward chromatic run, all flats before a downward chromatic run, etc.

<p class="comment">
Abjad implements quartertones but none of the other types of microtone. LilyPond now makes arrowed accidentals available and support for those is on the Abjad to-do list.
</p>

<p class="comment">
LilyPond implements several different accidental handling methods.
Abjad outputs LilyPond input with no special indications for accidental handling.
Nontonal music may prefer to use the LilyPond <code>'forget</code> option for handling accidentals.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Do we have an Abjad-native way of setting <code>'forget</code>?
</p>

<p class="comment">
Abjad currently allows the initialization of empty pitch with <code>Pitch( )</code>.
Future versions of Abjad may deprecate this behavior.
