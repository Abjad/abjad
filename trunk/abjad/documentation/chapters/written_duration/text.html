<h1>Written duration</h1>
<hr>
<p class="spacer" />

<p>
Consider durations below.
</p>
<pre>
  abjad> t1 = Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2
  abjad> Beam(t1)
  abjad> t2 = FixedDurationTuplet((4, 16), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 5)
  abjad> Beam(t2)
  abjad> t3 = FixedDurationTuplet((2, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 3)
  abjad> Beam(t3)
  abjad> measure = Measure((5, 8), t1 + [t2, t3])
  abjad> staff = Staff([measure])
  abjad> staff.invocation.type = 'RhythmicStaff'
  abjad> show(staff)
</pre>

<p>
The first two eighth notes carry their usual duration. But tuplet brackets scale the durations of the other notes.
</p>

<p>
Something similar happens here.
</p>
<pre>
  abjad> m1 = Measure((5, 16), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 5)
  abjad> Beam(m1)
  abjad> m2 = Measure((9, 20), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 9)
  abjad> Beam(m2)
  abjad> staff = Staff([m1, m2])
  abjad> staff.invocation.type = 'RhythmicStaff'
  abjad> show(staff)
</pre>
<image class="inline" src="images/2.png">
<p>
The first sixteenth notes carry their usual durations. But the other notes carry different durations altogether.
</p>

<p>
These examples show that the <strong>written duration</strong> and the <strong>prolated duration</strong> of notes can differ. The written and prolated durations of rests, chords and skips can also differ.
</p>

<p>
Abjad publishes the written duration of notes, rests, chords and skips as the <code>duration.written</code> attribute of those classes. Written duration is always available for these classes, whether prolated or not.
</p>
<pre>
  abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 8))
  abjad> note.duration.written
  Rational(1, 8)
</pre>
<pre>
  abjad> tuplet = FixedDurationTuplet((2, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 3)
  abjad> note = tuplet[0]
  abjad> note.duration.written
  Rational(1, 8)
</pre>

<h2>Commentary</h2>
<hr>

<p class="commentary">
1. The written and prolated duration of notes and rests participating rhythms without prolation always equal each other. Only the notes and rests of prolated rhythms may express different written and prolated durations.

<h2>To do</h2>
<hr>

<p class="commentary">
1. Would be nice to build some sort of switch to turn <i>duration-labeling</i> on leaves one at a time or as members of larger structures, analagously to the leaf-number switches we already have. Will take a little bit of thinking to come up with the right interface. This same note should apply to the structure labeling parts of the docs. Truning duration-labeling on would then clarify the examples in this chapter.
