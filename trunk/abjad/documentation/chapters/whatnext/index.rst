What next?
==========

Read all the Abjad Fundamentals next. These chapters explain the Leaf
Container Spanner (LCS) Model on which Abjad is based. These chapters
also explain how to work with all the basic Abjad components,
including notes, rests, chords and staves.

Read some of the chapters concerning materials generation to figure
out how to create starting materials.

And then read about structure traversal and manipulation to learn how to move around in large pieces of notation and change them while you go.

The most powerful features of Abjad are the set of interlocking models
that structure the system. Find out how Abjad models pitch, duration,
leaves and containers in the chapters on understanding the Abjad
model.

When you get stuck, check out the public interface in
the :doc:`Abjad API </chapters/api/index>` chapter.

And last, once as you start to add your own classes or helpers to
Abjad, read the chapter about developer concerns. We love
contributions from composers working in many different ways. So get in
touch and consider contributing to the project at any time.
