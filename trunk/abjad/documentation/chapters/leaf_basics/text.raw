<h1>Working with notes, rests, chords</h1>

<h2>Creating notes</h2>

<p>The Abjad <code>Note</code> class initializes with numeric pitch and duration values.

<pre>
  abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
  abjad> note
  Note(c', 4)
</pre>

<h2>Working with note duration</h2>

<p>You can assign values directly to the note duration interface.

<pre>
  abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
  abjad> note.duration = (1, 8)
  abjad> note
  Note(c', 8)
</pre>

<p>And you can compare note duration interfaces.

<pre>
  abjad> n1 = Note(0, (1, 4))
  abjad> n2 = Note(0, (3, 16))
  abjad> n1.duration > n2.duration
  True
</pre>

<p>You can do all the normal things with the note duration interface that you can do with the other Abjad duration interfaces.
These include copying and rewriting.
See the overview of <a href="../duration_interfaces">duration interfaces</a>.


<h2>Working with note pitch</h2>

<p>You can assign pitches to a note a note in a couple of different ways.

<pre>
  abjad> note.pitch = 1
  abjad> note
  Note(cs', 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> note.pitch = Pitch('d', 4)
  abjad> note
  Note(d', 4)
</pre>

<pre>
  abjad> note.pitch = ('ds', 4)
  abjad> note
  Note(ds', 4)
</pre>

<p>
See the chapter on <a href="../pitch/index.html">pitch</a> for more information.
