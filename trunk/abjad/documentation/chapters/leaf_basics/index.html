<h1>Working with notes, rests, chords</h1>

<h2>Creating notes</h2>

<p>The Abjad <code>Note</code> class initializes with numeric pitch and duration values.

<pre>
abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
abjad> note
Note(c', 4)
</pre>

<h2>Working with note duration</h2>

<p>You can assign values directly to the note duration interface.

<pre>
abjad> note = Note(0, (1, 4))
abjad> note.duration = (1, 8)
abjad> note
Note(c', 8)
</pre>

<p>And you can compare note duration interfaces.

<pre>
abjad> n1 = Note(0, (1, 4))
abjad> n2 = Note(0, (3, 16))
abjad> n1.duration > n2.duration
True
</pre>

<p>You can do all the normal things with the note duration interface that you can do with the other Abjad duration interfaces.
These include copying and rewriting.
See the overview of <a href="../duration_interfaces">duration interfaces</a>.


<h2>Working with note pitch</h2>

<p>You can assign pitches to a note a note in a couple of different ways.

<pre>
abjad> note.pitch = 1
abjad> note
Note(cs', 4)
</pre>

<pre>
abjad> note.pitch = Pitch('d', 4)
abjad> note
Note(d', 4)
</pre>

<pre>
abjad> note.pitch = ('ds', 4)
abjad> note
Note(ds', 4)
</pre>


<h2>Creating Rests</h2>

<p>The Abjad <code>Rest</code> initializes with a duration value only.

<pre>
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
abjad> rest
Rest(4)
abjad> show(rest)
</pre>

<h2><code>Rest</code> specific attributes</h2>

<p>In addition to the attributes inherited from the <code>_Leaf</code> class (such as <strong>duration</strong>, <strong>grace</strong>, etc.), the <code>Rest</code> class also possesses a <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 
This may seem strange given that Rests represent the absence of sound. 
However, as a glyph in a score, Rests also necessarily have a vertical position relative to the Staff. 
By default the vertical position of rests is set automatically by the LilyPond renderer, but it can be set arbitrarily with the <strong>pitch</strong> attribute. 

<pre>
abjad> rest = Rest((1, 4))
abjad> rest.pitch = -1
abjad> show(rest)
</pre>
<image src="images/2.png">

<p>Notice how the position of the rest is here moved down so it falls exactly on B<sub>3</sub>. 

<p>To remove the pitch from a <code>Rest</code> simply set the attribute to None.

<pre>
abjad> rest.pitch = None
</pre>
