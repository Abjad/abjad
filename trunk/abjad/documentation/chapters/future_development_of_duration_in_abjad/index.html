<h1>Future development of duration in Abjad</h1>
<hr>

<p>
One additional duration rewrite remains.
No <code>duration.absolute</code> attribute currently exists, and it needs to.
Also, both <code>_LeafDurationInterface</code> and the various container duration interfaces implement the comparison operators in suboptimal ways; that needs to fix, too.
Finally, we need to decide whether to give named-attributed access to the seven different combinations of <code>duration.written</code>, <code>duration.prolated</code> and <code>duration.multiplied</code> taken 1, 2 or 3 at a time, or, alternatively, whether to leave certain of the seven different combinations implicit.

<h2>Commentary</h2>
<hr>

<p class="commentary">
1. The duration model predates any of the other major subsystems in Abjad, going back to the first author's model of nested expressions in <i>Mathematica</i>.
The Python-based precusors to Abjad &mdash the first author's Lascaux and the second author's Cuepatlahto systems &mdash both included explicit <code>Duration</code> classes as, indeed, did the first versions of Abjad.
The decision to remove the explicit <code>Duration</code> class in favor of only <code>Rational</code> instances instead reflected a desire to simplify the core type classification of the system and externalize duration-specific formatting and analysis.
