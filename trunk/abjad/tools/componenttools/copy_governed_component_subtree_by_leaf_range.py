def copy_governed_component_subtree_by_leaf_range(component, start=0, stop=None):
    r'''.. versionadded:: 1.1

    Clone governed `component` subtree by leaf range.

    Governed subtree means `component` together with children of `component`.

    Leaf range refers to the sequential parentage of `component` from `start` leaf index
    to `stop` leaf index::

    Clone sequential containers in leaves' parentage up to
    the first parallel container in leaves' parentage.

    Trim and shrink cloned containers as necessary.

    When `stop` is none copy all leaves from `start` forward.
