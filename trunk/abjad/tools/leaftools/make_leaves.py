def make_leaves(pitches, durations, decrease_durations_monotonically=True, tie_rests=False):
    r'''.. versionadded:: 1.1

    Construct a list of notes, rests or chords.

    Set `pitches` is a single pitch, or a list of pitches, or a tuple
    of pitches.

    Integer pitches create notes. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([2, 4, 19], [(1, 4)])
        [Note("d'4"), Note("e'4"), Note("g''4")]

    Tuple pitches create chords. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8)], [(1, 4)])
        [Chord("<c' cs' d'>4"), Chord("<ef' e' f'>4"), Chord("<fs' g' af'>4")]

    Set `pitches` to a list of none to create rests. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([None, None, None, None], [(1, 8)])
        [Rest('r8'), Rest('r8'), Rest('r8'), Rest('r8')]

    You can mix and match pitch values. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([12, (1, 2, 3), None, 12], [(1, 4)])
        [Note("c''4"), Chord("<cs' d' ef'>4"), Rest('r4'), Note("c''4")]

    If the length of `pitches` is less than the length of `durations`,
    the function reads `durations` cyclically. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([13], [(1, 8), (1, 8), (1, 4), (1, 4)])
        [Note("cs''8"), Note("cs''8"), Note("cs''4"), Note("cs''4")]

    Set `durations` to a single duration, a list of duration, or
    a tuple of durations.

    If the length of `durations` is less than the length of `pitches`,
    the function reads `pitches` cyclically. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([13, 14, 15, 16], [(1, 8)])
        [Note("cs''8"), Note("d''8"), Note("ef''8"), Note("e''8")]

    Duration values not of the form ``m / 2 ** n`` return
    leaves nested inside a fixed-multiplier tuplet. ::

        >>> leaftools.make_leaves([14], [(1, 12), (1, 12), (1, 12)])
        [Tuplet(2/3, [d''8, d''8, d''8])]

    Set ``decrease_durations_monotonically=False`` to return tied leaf
    durations from least to greatest::

        >>> staff = Staff(leaftools.make_leaves([15], [(13, 16)],
        ...     decrease_durations_monotonically=False))
        >>> f(staff)
        \new Staff {
            ef''16 ~
            ef''2.
        }

    Set `tie_rests` to true to return tied rests for durations like
    ``5/16`` and ``9/16``. ::

        >>> staff = Staff(leaftools.make_leaves([None], [(5, 16)], tie_rests=True))
        >>> f(staff)
        \new Staff {
            r4 ~
            r16
        }

    Return list of leaves.
