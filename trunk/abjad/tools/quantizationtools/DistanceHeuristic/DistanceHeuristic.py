class DistanceHeuristic(Heuristic):
    r'''Concrete ``Heuristic`` subclass which considers only the 
    computed distance of each ``QGrid`` and the number of leaves of 
    that ``QGrid`` when choosing the optimal ``QGrid`` for a given 
    ``QTargetBeat``.

    The ``QGrid`` with the smallest distance and fewest number of 
    leaves will be selected.

    Return ``DistanceHeuristic`` instance.
