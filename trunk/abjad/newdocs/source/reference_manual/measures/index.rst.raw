Measures
========

Understanding measures in LilyPond
----------------------------------

In LilyPond you specify time signatures by hand and LilyPond creates measures automatically:

::

    \new Staff {
        \time 3/8
        c'8
        d'8
        e'8
        d'8
        e'8
        f'8
        \time 2/4
        g'4
        e'4
        f'4
        d'4
        c'2
    }

Here LilyPond creates five measures from two time signatures.
This happens because behind-the-scenes LilyPond time-keeping tells the program
when measures start and stop and how to draw the barlines that come between them.

Understanding measures in Abjad
-------------------------------

Measures are optional in Abjad, too, and you may omit them in favor of time signatures:

<abjad>
staff = Staff("c'8 d'8 e'8 d'8 e'8 f'8 g'4 e'4 f'4 d'4 c'2")
</abjad>

<abjad>
contexttools.TimeSignatureMark((3, 8))(staff)
contexttools.TimeSignatureMark((2, 4))(staff[6])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(staff, 'measures-1') <hide
</abjad>

But you may also include explicit measures in the Abjad scores you build.
The following sections explain how.

Creating measures
-----------------

Create a measure with a meter and music:

<abjad>
measure = Measure((3, 8), "c'8 d'8 e'8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-2') <hide
</abjad>

Working with dynamic measures
-----------------------------

Dynamic measures adjust their time signatures on the fly as you add
and remove music.

Create dynamic measures without a time signature:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.DynamicMeasure("c'8 d'8 e'8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-3') <hide
</abjad>

Adding music to dynamic measures
--------------------------------

Add music to dynamic measures the same as to all containers:

<abjad>
measure.extend([Note("fs'8"), Note("gs'8")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-4') <hide
</abjad>

Removing music from dynamic measures
------------------------------------

Remove music from dynamic measures the same as with other containers:

<abjad>
del(measure[1:3])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-5') <hide
</abjad>

Setting the denominator of dynamic measures
-------------------------------------------

You can set the denominator of dynamic measures to any integer power of ``2``:

<abjad>
measure.denominator = 32
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-6') <hide
</abjad>

Suppressing the meter of dynamic measures
-----------------------------------------

You can temporarily suppress the meter of dynamic measures:

<abjad>
measure.suppress_meter = True
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

LilyPond will engrave the last active meter.

Working with anonymous measures
-------------------------------

Anonymous determine their time signatures on the fly and then hide them at format time.

Create anonymous measures without a time signature:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure("c'8 d'8 e'8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-7') <hide
</abjad>

Adding music to anonymous measures
----------------------------------

Add music to anonymous measures the same as to other containers:

<abjad>
measure.extend([Note("fs'8"), Note("gs'8")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-8') <hide
</abjad>

Removing music from anonymous measures
--------------------------------------

Remove music from anonymous measure the same as from other containers:

<abjad>
del(measure[1:3])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'measures-9') <hide
</abjad>
