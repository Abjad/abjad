<h1>show( )</h1>

<subsection>
<p> The <code>show( )</code> helper is one of the most used helpers in Abjad. It is the link between your Abjad code and LilyPond. <code>show(expr)</code> calls LilyPond to render the given Abjad expression <code>expr</code> and immediately displays the score as a PDF. </p>

<p>Here's a simple example: </p>

<abjad>
   abjad> n = Note(0, (1, 4))
   abjad> show(n)
</abjad>

<p>
Note that <code>show(expr)</code> only works when <code>expr.format</code> exists. 
All Abjad objects divide into roughly two groups:

<ol>
   <li> Components
   <li> Spanners
</ol>

Components include notes, rests, chords and all other so-called "leaves"; components also include tuplets, measures, voices, staves and scores. 
Spanners include beams, slurs, ties, pedal mark, trills. Spanners also include <MetricGrid>.  
Spanners are special in that they do not implement a 'format' string, so they can not be passed to <code>show( )</code> directly.
Instead, apply a spanner to a Component and then <code>show( )</code> the Component.
</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>

<abjad>
   abjad> staff = Staff(construct.scale(4))
   abjad> b = Beam(staff)
</abjad>

<p><Beam> <code>b</code> is a Spanner, so passing <code>b</code> to <code>show( )</code> will throw and exception. Instead, pass <code>staff</code> to <code>show( )</code> and you will see the notes in the staff with the <Beam> spanner applied. </p>

<abjad>
   hide> staff = Staff(construct.scale(4))
   hide> b = Beam(staff)
   abjad> show(staff)
</abjad>
