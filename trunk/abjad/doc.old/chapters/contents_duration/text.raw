<h1>Contents duration</h1>

<subsection>

<p>
Abjad defines the <strong>contents duration</strong> of tuplets, measures, voices, staves and other containers equal to the sum of the <strong>preprolated duration</strong> of each of the elements in the container.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection>

<p>
The measure here contains two eighth notes and tuplet.
These elements carry preprolated durations equal to <tt>1/8</tt>, <tt>1/8</tt> and <tt>2/8</tt>, respectively.
</p>

<abjad>
  abjad> notes = Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2
  abjad> Beam(notes)
  abjad> tuplet = FixedDurationTuplet((2, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 3)
  abjad> Beam(tuplet)
  abjad> measure = Measure((4, 8), notes + [tuplet]) 
  abjad> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
  abjad> measure.duration.contents
  Rational(4, 8)
  abjad> show(staff)
</abjad>

<p>
The contents duration of the measure here equals <tt>1/8 + 1/8 + 2/8 = 4/8</tt>.
