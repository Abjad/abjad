   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Abjad (|release|)
=============================

Abjad helps composers build up complex pieces of music notation
in an iterative and incremental way. 
You can use Abjad to create a symbolic representation of all the 
notes, rests, staves, nested rhythms, beams, slurs and 
other notational elements in any score. 

.. note:: 
   The Abjad documentation is still very much a work in progress.
