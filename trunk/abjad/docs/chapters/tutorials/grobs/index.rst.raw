Understanding LilyPond grobs
============================

LilyPond models music notation as a collection of graphic objects or grobs.

Grobs control typography
------------------------

LilyPond grobs control the typographic details of the score:

<abjad>
staff = Staff("c'4 ( d'4 ) e'4 ( f'4 ) g'4 ( a'4 ) g'2")
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(staff)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff)
</abjad>

In the example above LilyPond creates a grob for every printed glyph.
This includes the clef and time signature as well as the note heads, stems and
slurs. If the example included beams, articulations or an explicit key signature
then LilyPond would create grobs for those as well.

Grobs can be overridden
-----------------------

You can change the appearance of LilyPond grobs with grob overrides:

<abjad>
staff.override.staff_symbol.color = 'blue'
staff.override.note_head.color = 'red'
staff.override.stem.color = 'red'
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(staff)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff, docs=True)
</abjad>

Nested Grob properties can be overriden
---------------------------------------

In the above example, `staff_symbol`, `note_head` and `stem` correspond to the LilyPond
grobs `StaffSymbol`, `NoteHead` and `Stem`, while `color` in each case is the color
properties of that graphic object.

It is not uncommon in LilyPond scores to see more complex overrides, consisting of a
grob name and a list of two or more property names:

::

    \override StaffGrouper #'staff-staff-spacing #'basic-distance = #7

To achieve the Abjad equivalent, simply concatenate the property names with double-underscores:

<abjad>
staff = Staff()
staff.override.staff_grouper.staff_staff_spacing__basic_distance = 7
f(staff)
</abjad>

Abjad will explode the double-underscore delimited Python property into a LilyPond property list.

Check the LilyPond docs
-----------------------

New grobs are added to LilyPond from time to time.
