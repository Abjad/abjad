Making one note
===============

Type the following and hit return:

::

	>>> Note("cs''4")


Now name the note and show:

::

	>>> note = Note("cs''4")
	>>> show(note)

.. image:: images/example-1.png

Abjad calls LilyPond and shows the PDF of the note you created.

Now you can look over your work and decide what comes next.
