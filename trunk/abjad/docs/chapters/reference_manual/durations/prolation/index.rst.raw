Prolation
=========


Abjad uses prolation as a cover term for rhythmic augmentation and diminution.
Augmentation increases the duration of notes, rests and chords.
Diminution does the opposite.
Western notation employs tuplet brackets and special types of time signature to effect prolation.


Tuplet prolation
----------------

Tuplets prolate their contents:

<abjad>
tuplet = Tuplet(Fraction(5, 4), 'c8 c c c')
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([Measure((5, 8), [tuplet])])
beam = beamtools.BeamSpanner(tuplet)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff, docs=True)
</abjad>

<abjad>
note = tuplet[0]
note.written_duration
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolation
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolated_duration
</abjad>

Notes here with written duration ``1/8`` carry prolation factor ``5/4``
and prolated duration ``5/32``.

Western notation does not recognize tuplet brackets carrying one-to-one ratios.  
Such trivial tuplets may, however, be useful during different stages of composition, 
and Abjad allows them for that reason. 
Trivial tuplets carry zero prolation. 
Zero-prolated tuplets neither augment nor diminish the music they contain.


Meter prolation
---------------

Time signatures in western notation usually carry a denominator equal
to a nonnegative integer power of ``2``.
Abjad calls these conventional meters binary meters.
Denominators equal to integers other than integer powers of ``2`` are also possible.
Such nonbinary meters rhythmically diminish the contents of the measures they govern:

<abjad>
measure = Measure((4, 10), 'c8 c c c')
beam = beamtools.BeamSpanner(measure)
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([measure])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff, docs=True)
</abjad>

<abjad>
note = staff.leaves[0]
note.prolation
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolated_duration
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolation
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolated_duration
</abjad>

Notes here with written duration ``1/8`` carry prolation factor ``4/5``
and prolated duration ``1/10``.

Abjad implements one of two competing nonbinary meter-interpretation schemes.
The first, implicit meter-interpretation given here, follows, for example, Ferneyhough, 
in that nonbinary meters prolate the contents of the measures they govern implicitly, ie, without recourse to tuplet brackets.
The second, explicit meter-interpretation, which we find in, for example, Sciarrino, 
insists instead on the presence of some tuplet bracket, 
usually engraved in some broken or incomplete way.
The implicit meter-interpretation that Abjad implements differs from the explicit meter-interpretation native to LilyPond. 
Abjad will eventually implement both implicit and explicit meter-interpretation, 
settable on a container-by-container basis.


The prolation chain
-------------------

Tuplets nest and combine freely with different types of meter.
When two or more prolation donors conspire, the prolation factor they
collectively bestow on leaf-level music equals the cumulative product of all
prolation factors in the prolation chain.
All durated components carry a prolation chain:

<abjad>
tuplet = tuplettools.FixedDurationTuplet(Duration(4, 8), 'c16 c c c c c c')
beamtools.BeamSpanner(tuplet)
measure = Measure((4, 10), [tuplet])
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([measure])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff, docs=True)
</abjad>

<abjad>
measure.multiplier
</abjad>

<abjad>
note = measure.leaves[0]
note.prolation
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.prolated_duration
</abjad>

Notes here with written duration ``1/16`` carry prolated duration ``2/35``.
