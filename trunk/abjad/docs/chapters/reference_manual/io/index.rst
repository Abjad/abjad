Reopening Abjad PDFs
--------------------

After you build a piece of notation and open 
with :py:func:`~abjad.tools.iotools.show` you will usually
close the resulting PDF and continue working, changing your
output notation in an iterative and incremental way. ::

   abjad> staff = Staff(construct.scale(8))
   abjad> show(staff)

But what if you need to go back and open the resulting PDF again?
Abjad provides :func:`~abjad.tools.iotools.pdf` for precisely this purpose.
Type the following at the Abjad prompt to open the most recent
PDF written by Abjad. ::

   abjad> pdf()

If you want to open not the next-to-most recent PDF generated by Abjad,
pass in a ``-1``. And for the next-to-next-to-most recent,
pass in a ``-2``, and so on.


Looking at LilyPond output
--------------------------

Abjad generates a LilyPond ``.ly`` file for every Abjad expression
that you build and :func:`~abjad.tools.iotools.show`.
To look at these LilyPond ``.ly`` files that Abjad builds
behind the scenes, use :func:`~abjad.tools.iotools.ly`. ::

   abjad> ly()

::

   % Abjad revision 2362
   % 2009-06-25 10:30

   \version "2.12.2"
   \include "english.ly"
   \include "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/trunk/abjad/scm/abjad.scm"

   \new Staff {
      c'8
      d'8
      e'8
      f'8
      g'8
      a'8
      b'8
      c''8
   }

Abjad opens the LilyPond ``.ly`` file in your favorite text editor.

These LilyPond ``.ly`` files that Abjad generates all have the same basic
structure. The current version of Abjad and the date appear first,
followed by the mandatory LilyPond version string and LilyPond
directives for English note names and the default Abjad ``.scm`` file.
The remainder of the file is reserved for the LilyPond input code
corresponding to the expression you just built in Abjad.

When you are done looking at the LilyPond ``.ly`` file quit your
text editor to return to the Abjad interpreter.
   

Looking at the LilyPond log
---------------------------

If things go wrong when you call :func:`~abjad.tools.iotools.show` or one
of the other Abjad functions that call LilyPond behind the scenes,
if may be helpful to examine the output that LilyPond writes to the
LilyPond log. ::

   abjad> log()

::

   GNU LilyPond 2.12.2
   Processing `1420.ly'
   Parsing...
   Interpreting music...
   Preprocessing graphical objects...
   Finding the ideal number of pages...
   Fitting music on 1 page...
   Drawing systems...
   Layout output to `1420.ps'...
   Converting to `./1420.pdf'...

This is the normal output that LilyPond generates every time you
call the program behind. 
When you are done looking at the LilyPond log, quit your text
editor to return to the Abjad interpreter.
