Working with LilyPond multipliers
=================================

The LilyPond ``*`` operator allows the creation of duration multipliers
against notes, rests, chords and skips.

You can assign LilyPond multipliers in Abjad:

<abjad>
note = Note("c'4")
note.duration_multiplier = Fraction(1, 6)
</abjad>

LilyPond multipliers change the multiplied duration of notes, rests, chords and skips:

<abjad>
note.multiplied_duration
print repr(note.multiplied_duration) <hide
</abjad>

LilyPond multipliers leave written duration unchanged:

<abjad>
note.written_duration
print repr(note.written_duration) <hide
</abjad>
