Why LilyPond is right for Abjad
===============================

Early versions of Abjad wrote MIDI files for input to Finale and Sibelius.
Later versions of Abjad wrote ``.pbx`` files for input into Leland Smith's SCORE.
Over time we found LilyPond superior to Finale, Sibelius and SCORE.

Nested tuplets works out of the box
-----------------------------------

LilyPond uses a single construct to nest tuplets arbitrarily:

::

    \new stafftools.RhythmicStaff {
        \time 7/8
        \times 7/8 {
            c8.
            \times 7/5 { c16 c16 c16 c16 c16 }
            \times 3/5 { c8 c8 c8 c8 c8 }
        }
    }

<abjad>
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([Measure((7, 8), [])])
measure = staff[0]
measure.append(Note('c8.'))
measure.append(Tuplet(Fraction(7, 5), 5 * Note('c16')))
spannertools.BeamSpanner(measure[-1])
measure.append(Tuplet(Fraction(3, 5), 5 * Note('c8')))
spannertools.BeamSpanner(measure[-1])
Tuplet(Fraction(7, 8), measure.music)
staff.override.tuplet_bracket.bracket_visibility = True
staff.override.tuplet_bracket.padding = 1.6
show(staff)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(staff, 'lilypond-1', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

LilyPond's tuplet input syntax works the same as any other recursive construct.

Broken tuplets work out of the box
----------------------------------

LilyPond engraves tupletted notes interrupted by nontupletted notes correctly:

::

    \new Staff {
        \times 4/7 { c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 }
        c'8 c'8
        \times 4/7 { c'16 c'16 c'16 }
    }

<abjad>
t = Tuplet(Fraction(4, 7), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4)
notes = Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2
u = Tuplet(Fraction(4, 7), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 3)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(t)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(notes)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(u)
measure = Measure((4, 8), [t] + notes + [u])
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([measure])
show(staff)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(staff, 'lilypond-2', 'oedo') <hide
</abjad>

Nonbinary meters work out of the box
------------------------------------

The rhythm above rewrites with time signatures in place of tuplets:

::

    \new Staff {
        \time 4/28 c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 |
        \time 2/8  c'8  c'8 |
        \time 3/28 c'16 c'16 c'16 |
    }

<abjad>
t = Measure((4, 28), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4)
u = Measure((2, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2)
v = Measure((3, 28), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 3)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(t)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(u)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(v)
staff = stafftools.RhythmicStaff([t, u, v])
show(staff)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(staff, 'lilypond-3') <hide
</abjad>

The time signatures ``4/28`` and ``3/28`` here have a denominator not
equal to ``4``, ``8``, ``16`` or any other nonnegative integer power of two.
Abjad calls such time signatures **nonbinary meters** and LilyPond engraves them correctly.

Lilypond models the musical measure correctly
---------------------------------------------

Most engraving packages make the concept of the measure out to be
more important than it should. We see evidence of this wherever an
engraving package makes it difficult for either a long note
or the notes of a tuplet to cross a barline.
These difficulties come from working the idea of measure-as-container
deep into object model of the package.

There is a competing way to model the musical measure that we might call
the measure-as-background way of thinking about things.
Western notation pratice started absent any concept of the barline,
introduced the idea gradually,
and has since retreated from the necessity of the convention.
Engraving packages that pick out an understanding of the barline
from the 18th or 19th centuries subscribe to the measure-as-container
view of things and oversimplify the problem.
One result of this is to render certain barline-crossing rhythmic figures
either an inelegant hack or an outright impossibility.
LilyPond eschews the measure-as-container model in favor of the measure-as-background
model better able to handle both earlier and later notation practice.
