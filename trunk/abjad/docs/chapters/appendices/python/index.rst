Why Python is right for Abjad
=============================

Abjad is an interactive software system designed to help composers
build up complex pieces of music notation in an iterative and
incremental way. Straightforward procedural syntax, the availability
of basic functional constructs, and the interactive interpreter make
Python the natural choice for Abjad.
