Why LilyPond is right for Abjad
===============================

It took us several years to settle on LilyPond. Early versions of
Abjad wrote out MIDI files for input to Finale and Sibelius. Later,
more typographhically powerful versions of Abjad wrote out cleartext
.pbx files for input into Leland Smith's SCORE. But over time we found
LilyPond superior to Finale, Sibelius and SCORE. Here we give some
examples to show why.



Nested tuplets works out of the box
-----------------------------------

LilyPond uses just one construct to create tuplets. Nest these
recursively to make tuplets as deep as you want.

::
    
    \new RhythmicStaff {
       \times 4/5 {
          \times 4/5 { c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 }
          \times 3/5 { c'8 c'8 c'8 c'8 c'8 }
       }
    }


<abjad>
   hide> t = FixedDurationTuplet((4, 16), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 5)
   hide> u = FixedDurationTuplet((3, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 5)
   hide> v = FixedDurationTuplet((4, 8), [t, u])
   hide> measure = RigidMeasure(v.duration.preprolated, [v])
   hide> measure.meter.transparent = True
   hide> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
   hide> write(staff, 'lily_example1')
</abjad>


We like LilyPond's tuplet input syntax because it works exactly the
same way as any other recursive programming structure, such as, for
example, any collection of nested attribute or element tags in XML. By
way of comparison, until the relatively recent appearance of version 5
of the ManuScript scripting language, Sibelius offered no programmatic
way to create tuplets at all. (For our guess as to why, see the last
section of this page on why measures shouldn't dominate your object
model.)



Broken tuplets work out of the box
----------------------------------

Engraving seven septuplets is easy. It's harder to engrave four
septuplets, then something else, then three more septuplets. In
LilyPond, such broken tuplets work out of the box.

::
    
    \new Staff {
       \times 4/7 { c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 }
       c'8 c'8
       \times 4/7 { c'16 c'16 c'16 }
    }


<abjad>
   hide> t = FixedMultiplierTuplet((4, 7), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4)
   hide> notes = Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2
   hide> u = FixedMultiplierTuplet((4, 7), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 3)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(t)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(notes)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(u)
   hide> measure = RigidMeasure((4, 8), [t] + notes + [u])
   hide> staff = RhythmicStaff([measure])
   hide> write(staff, 'lily_example2')
</abjad>


We like this because it shows that LilyPond understands tuplets as
carrying a fixed multiplier rather than fitting into a fixed duration
. This means that LilyPond sees each of the first notes above as
carrying a duration equal to exactly 1/16 * 4/7 == 1/28 of a whole
note. How many 1/28th notes you choose to string together is left to
the user. LilyPond is perfectly happy to string seven 1/28th notes
together in the usual way. But LilyPond is also perfectly willing to
string only four or three 1/28th notes together, as we've done here.
The point is that LilyPond is happy to multiply any note anywhere in
any score by any rational factor without placing a constraint on the
total number of such notes taken in sequence . This is what we mean
when we point to the idea that LilyPond understands tuplets as
carrying a fixed multiplier. Conversely, when we think of seven
septuplets "in the time of" four, we're thinking of tuplets as fitting
into fixed duration. That is, we're thinking about the total duration
into which the complete figure will fit. But what's important here is
this: fixed-multiplier tuplets generalize fixed-duration tuplets.
LilyPond's multiplier-based approach to tuplets lets us create not
only the complete tuplets we would expect but many more besides.



Nonbinary meters work out of the box
------------------------------------

We can rewrite the rhythm above in another way.

::

    
    \new Staff {
       \time 4/28 c'16 c'16 c'16 c'16 |
       \time 2/8  c'8  c'8 |
       \time 3/28 c'16 c'16 c'16 |
    }


<abjad>
   hide> t = RigidMeasure((4, 28), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 4)
   hide> u = RigidMeasure((2, 8), Note(0, (1, 8)) * 2)
   hide> v = RigidMeasure((3, 28), Note(0, (1, 16)) * 3)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(t)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(u)
   hide> spannertools.BeamSpanner(v)
   hide> staff = RhythmicStaff([t, u, v])
   hide> write(staff, 'lily_example3')
</abjad>


The time signatures 4/28 and 3/28 here have a denominator not equal to
4, 8, 16 or any other nonnegative integer power of two. Abjad calls
time signatures of this form nonbinary meters . Nonbinary meters break
many engraving programs. But, in LilyPond, nonbinary meters work out
of the box.



Lilypond models the musical measure correctly
---------------------------------------------

Most engraving packages make the concept of the measure out to be far
more important than it should be. We see evidence of this wherever an
engraving package makes it difficult or impossible for a long note
cross over a barline (as can happen in Medieval music) or for the
notes in a tuplet to cross over a barline (as can happen in New
Music). Both difficulties come from working the idea of measure-as-
container deep into engraving package object model. There is a
competing way to model the musical measure and we might call this the
measure-as-background way of thinking about things. When we look at
the development of western notation, we see that the system started
absent any concept of the barline, gradually introduced the idea, but
has since retreated from the inviolability of the convention.
Engraving packages that pick out a solidy Classical or Romantic
understanding of the barline subscribe to the measure-as-container
view of things and oversimplify the problem. One result of which is to
render certain barline-crossing rhythmic figures either an inelegant
hack or an outright impossibility. The measure-as-background model
fits the concept of the musical measure into the rhythmic model in a
more general way. LilyPond eschews the measure-as-container model
beloved of the common practice in favor of the measure-as-background
model characteristic of both the earlier and later uses of the western
notation. And Abjad agrees.
