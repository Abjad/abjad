Working with measures
=====================


Understanding measures in LilyPond
----------------------------------

In LilyPond you specify time signatures by hand and LilyPond creates measures automatically:

::

   \new Staff {
      \time 3/8
      c'8
      d'8
      e'8
      d'8
      e'8
      f'8
      \time 2/4
      g'4
      e'4
      f'4
      d'4
      c'2
   }

.. image:: images/example-1.png

Here LilyPond creates five measures from two time signatures.
This happens because behind-the-scenes LilyPond time-keeping tells the program 
when measures start and stop and how to draw the barlines that come between them.

Understanding measures in Abjad
-------------------------------

Measures are optional in Abjad, too, and you may omit them in favor of time signatures:

<abjad>
staff = Staff("c'8 d'8 e'8 d'8 e'8 f'8 g'4 e'4 f'4 d'4 c'2")
</abjad>

<abjad>
contexttools.TimeSignatureMark((3, 8))(staff)
contexttools.TimeSignatureMark((2, 4))(staff[6])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(staff, 'example-1') <hide
</abjad>

But you may also include explicit measures in the Abjad scores you build.
The following sections explain how.

Creating measures
-----------------

Create a measure with a meter and music:

<abjad>
measure = Measure((3, 8), macros.scale(3))
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-2') <hide
</abjad>
