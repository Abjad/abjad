Working with measures
=====================

Measures
--------

Create a measure with a meter and music:

<abjad>
measure = Measure((3, 8), macros.scale(3))
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-1') <hide
</abjad>

Dynamic measures
----------------

Use a dynamic measure if you want a measure that grows and shinks 
as you add and remove music:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.DynamicMeasure(macros.scale(4))
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-2') <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
measure.pop(-1)
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-3') <hide
</abjad>

Anonymous measures
------------------

Use an anonymous measure is you want a measure that grows and shrinks
as you add music and that also hides its time signature:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure(macros.scale(4))
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-4') <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
measure.pop(-1)
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-5') <hide
</abjad>
