Working with dynamic measures
=============================

Dynamic measures adjust their time signatures on the fly as you add
and remove music.

Creating dynamic measures
-------------------------

Create dynamic measures without a time signature:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.DynamicMeasure("c'8 d'8 e'8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-1') <hide
</abjad>

Adding music to dynamic measures
--------------------------------

Add music to dynamic measures the same as to all containers:

<abjad>
measure.extend([Note("fs'8"), Note("gs'8")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-2') <hide
</abjad>

Removing music from dynamic measures
------------------------------------

Remove music from dynamic measures the same as with other containers:

<abjad>
del(measure[1:3])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-3') <hide
</abjad>

Setting the denominator of dynamic measures
-------------------------------------------

You can set the denominator of dynamic measures to any integer power of ``2``:

<abjad>
measure.denominator = 32
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-4') <hide
</abjad>

Suppressing the meter of dynamic measures
-----------------------------------------

You can temporarily suppress the meter of dynamic measures:

<abjad>
measure.suppress_meter = True
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(measure)
</abjad>

LilyPond will engrave the last active meter.
