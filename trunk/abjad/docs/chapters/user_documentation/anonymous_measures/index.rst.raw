Working with anonymous measures
===============================

Anonymous determine their time signatures on the fly and then hide them at format time.

Creating anonymous measures
---------------------------

Create anonymous measures without a time signature:

<abjad>
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure("c'8 d'8 e'8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-1') <hide
</abjad>

Adding music to anonymous measures
----------------------------------

Add music to anonymous measures the same as to other containers:

<abjad>
measure.extend([Note("fs'8"), Note("gs'8")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-2') <hide
</abjad>

Removing music from anonymous measures
--------------------------------------

Remove music from anonymous measure the same as from other containers:

<abjad>
del(measure[1:3])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(measure)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-3') <hide
</abjad>
