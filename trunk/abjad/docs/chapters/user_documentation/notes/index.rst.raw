Working with notes
==================

Making notes from a string
--------------------------

You can make notes from string:

<abjad>
note = Note("c'4")
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(note)
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([note]) <hide
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-1', 'oedo.ly') <hide
</abjad>

Making notes from chromatic pitch number and duration
-----------------------------------------------------

You can also make notes from chromatic pitch number and duration:

<abjad>
note = Note(0, Duration(1, 4))
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(note)
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([note]) <hide
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-2', 'oedo.ly') <hide
</abjad>

(You even use ``Note(0, (1, 4))`` to create notes with numbers alone.)

Getting the written pitch of notes
----------------------------------

You can get the written pitch of notes:

<abjad>
note.pitch
print repr(note.pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Changing the written pitch of notes
-----------------------------------

And you can change the written pitch of notes:

<abjad>
note.pitch = "cs'"
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-3', 'oedo.ly') <hide
</abjad>

(You can use ``note.pitch = 1`` to change pitch with numbers, too.)

Getting the duration attributes of notes
----------------------------------------

Get the written duration of notes like this:

<abjad>
note.duration.written
print repr(note.duration.written) <hide
</abjad>

Which is usually the same as preprolated duration:

<abjad>
note.duration.preprolated
print repr(note.duration.preprolated) <hide
</abjad>

And prolated duration:

<abjad>
note.duration.prolated
print repr(note.duration.prolated) <hide
</abjad>

Except for notes inside a tuplet:

<abjad>
tuplet = Tuplet((2, 3), [Note("c'4"), Note("d'4"), Note("e'4")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(tuplet)
measure = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([tuplet]) <hide
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-4', 'oedo.ly') <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
note = tuplet[0]
</abjad>

Tupletted notes carry written duration:

<abjad>
note.duration.written
print repr(note.duration.written) <hide
</abjad>

Prolation:

<abjad>
note.duration.prolation
print repr(note.duration.prolation) <hide
</abjad>

And prolated duration that is the product of the two:

<abjad>
note.duration.prolated
print repr(note.duration.prolated) <hide
</abjad>

Changing the written duration of notes
--------------------------------------

You can change the written duration of notes:

<abjad>
tuplet[0].duration.written = Duration(1, 8)
tuplet[1].duration.written = Duration(1, 8)
tuplet[2].duration.written = Duration(1, 8)
spannertools.BeamSpanner(tuplet) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(tuplet)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(measure, 'example-5', 'oedo.ly') <hide
</abjad>

Other duration attributes are read-only.
