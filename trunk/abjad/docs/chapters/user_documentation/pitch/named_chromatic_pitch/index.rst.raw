Working with named chromatic pitches
====================================

Named chromatic pitches are the everyday pitches attached to notes and chords:

<abjad>
note = Note("cs''8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.pitch
print repr(note.pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Creation
--------

Use pitch tools to create named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("cs''")
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Name inspection
---------------

Use ``str( )`` to get the name of named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
str(named_chromatic_pitch)
print str(named_chromatic_pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Octave inspection
-----------------

Get the octave number of named chromatic pitches with ``octave_number``:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.octave_number
print named_chromatic_pitch.octave_number <hide
</abjad>

Sorting
-------

Named chromatic pitches sort by octave, diatonic pitch-class and accidental,
in that order:

<abjad>
pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('es') < pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('ff')
print repr(pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('es') < pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('ff')) <hide
</abjad>

Pitch comparison
----------------

Compare named chromatic pitches to each other:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("c''")
named_chromatic_pitch_2 = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("d''")
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 == named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 == named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 != named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 != named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 > named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 > named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 < named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 < named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 >= named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 >= named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 <= named_chromatic_pitch_2
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch_1 <= named_chromatic_pitch_2) <hide
</abjad>

Pitch conversion
----------------

Convert any named chromatic pitch to a named diatonic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch) <hide
</abjad>

To a numbered chromatic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Or to a numbered diatonic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch) <hide
</abjad>

Pitch-class conversion
----------------------

Convert any named chromatic pitch to a named chromatic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_chromatic_pitch_class
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.named_chromatic_pitch_class) <hide
</abjad>

To a named diatonic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch_class
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch_class) <hide
</abjad>

To a numbered chromatic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch_class
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch_class) <hide
</abjad>

Or to a numbered diatonic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch_class
print repr(named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch_class) <hide
</abjad>

Copying
-------

Use ``copy.copy( )`` to copy named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
import copy
</abjad>

<abjad>
copy.copy(named_chromatic_pitch)
print repr(copy.copy(named_chromatic_pitch)) <hide
</abjad>

Or use ``copy.deepcopy( )`` to do the same thing:

<abjad>
copy.deepcopy(named_chromatic_pitch)
print repr(copy.deepcopy(named_chromatic_pitch)) <hide
</abjad>
