Making one note
===============

Type the following and hit return:

<abjad>
Note("cs''4")
</abjad>

Now name the note and show:

<abjad>
note = Note("cs''4")
show(note)
iotools.write_expr_to_ly(note, 'example-1') <hide
</abjad>

Abjad calls LilyPond and shows the PDF of the note you created.

Now you can look over your work and decide what comes next.
