Setting spacing scorewide
-------------------------

You can use the ``SpacingInterface`` to set spacing attributes scorewide.

Here is a score with no explicit spacing.

<abjad>
score = Score([Staff(macros.scale(4, Rational(1, 4)))])
show(score)
write_ly(score, '1') <hide
</abjad>

Here is the same score with LilyPond's proportional notation turned on.

<abjad>
score.spacing.proportional_notation_duration = Rational(1, 16)
print score.format
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(score)
write_ly(score, '2') <hide
</abjad>
