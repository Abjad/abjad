Rests
=====

Making rests from strings
-------------------------

You can make rests from a string:

<abjad>
rest = Rest('r8')
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(rest)
</abjad>

Making rests from durations
---------------------------

You can also make rests from a duration:

<abjad>
rest = Rest(Duration(1, 4))
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(rest)
</abjad>

(You can even use ``Rest((1, 8))`` to make rests from a duration pair.)

Getting the duration attributes of rests
----------------------------------------

Get the written duration of rests like this:

<abjad>
rest.written_duration
</abjad>

Which is usually the same as preprolated duration:

<abjad>
rest.preprolated_duration
</abjad>

And prolated duration:

<abjad>
rest.duration
</abjad>

Except for rests inside a tuplet:

<abjad>
tuplet = Tuplet(Fraction(2, 3), [Note("c'4"), Rest('r4'), Note("e'4")])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(tuplet)
</abjad>

<abjad>
rest = tuplet[1]
</abjad>

Tupletted rests carry written duration:

<abjad>
rest.written_duration
</abjad>

Prolation:

<abjad>
rest.prolation
</abjad>

And prolated duration that is the product of the two:

<abjad>
rest.duration
</abjad>

Changing the written duration of rests
--------------------------------------

You can change the written duration of notes and rests:

<abjad>
tuplet[0].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)
tuplet[1].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)
tuplet[2].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(tuplet)
</abjad>

Other duration attributes are read-only.
