Rests
=====

Making rests from strings
-------------------------

You can make rests from a string:

::

   >>> rest = Rest('r8')


::

   >>> show(rest)

.. image:: images/index-1.png


Making rests from durations
---------------------------

You can also make rests from a duration:

::

   >>> rest = Rest(Duration(1, 4))


::

   >>> show(rest)

.. image:: images/index-2.png


(You can even use ``Rest((1, 8))`` to make rests from a duration pair.)

Getting the duration attributes of rests
----------------------------------------

Get the written duration of rests like this:

::

   >>> rest.written_duration
   Duration(1, 4)


Which is usually the same as preprolated duration:

::

   >>> rest.preprolated_duration
   Duration(1, 4)


And prolated duration:

::

   >>> rest.duration
   Duration(1, 4)


Except for rests inside a tuplet:

::

   >>> tuplet = Tuplet(Fraction(2, 3), [Note("c'4"), Rest('r4'), Note("e'4")])


::

   >>> show(tuplet)

.. image:: images/index-3.png


::

   >>> rest = tuplet[1]


Tupletted rests carry written duration:

::

   >>> rest.written_duration
   Duration(1, 4)


Prolation:

::

   >>> rest.prolation
   Multiplier(2, 3)


And prolated duration that is the product of the two:

::

   >>> rest.duration
   Duration(1, 6)


Changing the written duration of rests
--------------------------------------

You can change the written duration of notes and rests:

::

   >>> tuplet[0].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)
   >>> tuplet[1].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)
   >>> tuplet[2].written_duration = Duration(1, 8)


::

   >>> show(tuplet)

.. image:: images/index-4.png


Other duration attributes are read-only.
