Pitches
=======

Named chromatic pitches are the everyday pitches attached to notes and chords:

<abjad>
note = Note("cs''8")
</abjad>

<abjad>
note.written_pitch
</abjad>


Creating pitches
----------------

Use pitch tools to create named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("cs''")
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch
</abjad>


Inspecting the name of a pitch
------------------------------

Use ``str()`` to get the name of named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
str(named_chromatic_pitch)
</abjad>


Inspecting the octave of a pitch
--------------------------------

Get the octave number of named chromatic pitches with ``octave_number``:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.octave_number
</abjad>


Working with pitch deviation
----------------------------

Use deviation to model the fact that two pitches differ by a fraction of a semitone:

<abjad>
note_1 = Note(24, (1, 2))
note_2 = Note(24, (1, 2))
staff = Staff([note_1, note_2])
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff)
</abjad>

<abjad>
note_2.written_pitch = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch(24, deviation = -31)
</abjad>

The pitch of the the first note is greater than the pitch of the second:

<abjad>
note_1.written_pitch > note_2.written_pitch
</abjad>

Use markup to include indications of pitch deviation in your score:

<abjad>
markuptools.Markup(note_2.written_pitch.deviation_in_cents, Up)(note_2)
</abjad>


Sorting pitches
---------------

Named chromatic pitches sort by octave, diatonic pitch-class and accidental,
in that order:

<abjad>
pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('es') < pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch('ff')
</abjad>


Comparing pitches
-----------------

Compare named chromatic pitches to each other:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("c''")
named_chromatic_pitch_2 = pitchtools.NamedChromaticPitch("d''")
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 == named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 != named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 > named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 < named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 >= named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch_1 <= named_chromatic_pitch_2
</abjad>


Converting one type of pitch to another
---------------------------------------

Convert any named chromatic pitch to a named diatonic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch
</abjad>

To a numbered chromatic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch
</abjad>

Or to a numbered diatonic pitch:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch
</abjad>


Converting pitches to pitch-classes
-----------------------------------

Convert any named chromatic pitch to a named chromatic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_chromatic_pitch_class
</abjad>

To a named diatonic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.named_diatonic_pitch_class
</abjad>

To a numbered chromatic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch_class
</abjad>

Or to a numbered diatonic pitch-class:

<abjad>
named_chromatic_pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch_class
</abjad>


Copying pitches
---------------

Use ``copy.copy()`` to copy named chromatic pitches:

<abjad>
import copy
</abjad>

<abjad>
copy.copy(named_chromatic_pitch)
</abjad>

Or use ``copy.deepcopy()`` to do the same thing.


Accidental abbreviations
------------------------

Abjad abbreviates accidentals according to the LilyPond ``english.ly`` module:

    ======================         ============================
    accidental name                  abbreviation
    ======================         ============================
    quarter sharp                      'qs'
    quarter flat                        'qf'
    sharp                                 's'
    flat                                  'f'
    three-quarters sharp             'tqs'
    three-quarters flat              'tqf'
    double sharp                        'ss'
    double flat                         'ff'
    ======================         ============================


Chromatic pitch numbers
-----------------------

Abjad numbers chromatic pitches by semitone with middle C set equal to 0:

.. image:: images/chromatic-pitch-numbers.png

The code to generate this table is as follows::

    score, treble_staff, bass_staff = scoretools.make_empty_piano_score()
    duration = Fraction(1, 32)

    treble = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([])
    bass = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([])

    treble_staff.append(treble)
    bass_staff.append(bass)

    pitches = range(-12, 12 + 1)

    pitchtools.set_default_accidental_spelling('sharps')

    for i in pitches:
        note = Note(i, duration)
        rest = Rest(duration)
        clef = pitchtools.suggest_clef_for_named_chromatic_pitches([note.pitch])
        if clef == contexttools.ClefMark('treble'):
            treble.append(note)
            bass.append(rest)
        else:
            treble.append(rest)
            bass.append(note)
        diatonic_pitch_number = str(note.pitch.numbered_chromatic_pitch)
        markuptools.Markup(diatonic_pitch_number, Down)(bass[-1])

    score.override.rest.transparent = True
    score.override.stem.stencil = False

Diatonic pitch numbers
----------------------

Abjad numbers diatonic pitches by staff space with middle C set equal to 0:

.. image:: images/diatonic-pitch-numbers.png

The code to generate this table is as follows::

    score, treble_staff, bass_staff = scoretools.make_empty_piano_score()
    duration = Fraction(1, 32)

    treble = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([])
    bass = measuretools.AnonymousMeasure([])

    treble_staff.append(treble)
    bass_staff.append(bass)

    pitches = []
    diatonic_pitches = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]

    pitches.extend([-24 + x for x in diatonic_pitches])
    pitches.extend([-12 + x for x in diatonic_pitches])
    pitches.extend([0 + x for x in diatonic_pitches])
    pitches.extend([12 + x for x in diatonic_pitches])
    pitches.append(24)
    pitchtools.set_default_accidental_spelling('sharps')

    for i in pitches:
        note = Note(i, duration)
        rest = Rest(duration)
        clef = pitchtools.suggest_clef_for_named_chromatic_pitches([note.pitch])
        if clef == contexttools.ClefMark('treble'):
            treble.append(note)
            bass.append(rest)
        else:
            treble.append(rest)
            bass.append(note)
        diatonic_pitch_number = abs(note.pitch.numbered_diatonic_pitch)
        markuptools.Markup(diatonic_pitch_number, Down)(bass[-1])

    score.override.rest.transparent = True
    score.override.stem.stencil = False

Octave designation
------------------

Abjad designates octaves with both numbers and ticks:

    ===============        =============
    Octave notation        Tick notation
    ===============        =============
            C7                         c''''
            C6                         c'''
            C5                         c''
            C4                         c'
            C3                         c
            C2                         c,
            C1                         c,,
    ===============        =============

Accidental spelling
-------------------

Abjad chooses between enharmonic spellings at pitch-initialization
according to the following table:

    ============================        ====================================
    Chromatic pitch-class number        Chromatic pitch-class name (default)
    ============================        ====================================
        0                                        C
        1                                        C#
        2                                        D
        3                                        Eb
        4                                        E
        5                                        F
        6                                        F#
        7                                        G
        8                                        Gb
        9                                        A
        10                                     Bb
        11                                     B
    ============================        ====================================

<abjad>
staff = Staff([Note(n, (1, 8)) for n in range(12)])
show(staff)
</abjad>

Use pitch tools to respell with sharps:

<abjad>
pitchtools.respell_named_chromatic_pitches_in_expr_with_sharps(staff)
show(staff)
</abjad>

Or flats:

<abjad>
pitchtools.respell_named_chromatic_pitches_in_expr_with_flats(staff)
show(staff)
</abjad>
