Welcome to Abjad (|release|)
=============================

.. only:: html

    Abjad helps composers build up complex pieces of music notation
    in an iterative and incremental way. 
    Use Abjad to create a symbolic representation of all the notes, 
    rests, staves, tuplets, beams and slurs in any score.
    Because Abjad extends the Python programming language,
    you can use Abjad to make systematic changes to your music as you work.
    And because Abjad wraps the powerful LilyPond music notation package,
    you can use Abjad to control the typographic details of the symbols on the page.
