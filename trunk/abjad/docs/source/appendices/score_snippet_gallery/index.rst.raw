Score Snippet Gallery
=====================


Abjad uses a collection of score snippets in many places throughout the
docs, tests and other parts of the codebase. Some of these are collected here.


Score snippet 1
---------------

This score features two measures with a beam spanner applied to each measure
and a slur spanner applied to all the notes in the score:

<abjad>
staff = Staff(r"abj: | 2/8 c'8 d'8 || 2/8 e'8 f'8 |")
beamtools.apply_beam_spanners_to_measures_in_expr(staff)
spannertools.SlurSpanner(staff.leaves)
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(staff)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(staff)
</abjad>

Score snippet 1 is used widely in the component split tests.
