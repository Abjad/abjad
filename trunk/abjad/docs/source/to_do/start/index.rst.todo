To start Abjad, type ``abj`` at any shell prompt. [#f1]_ 
The Abjad intepreter appears.

.. sourcecode:: python

    abjad>

Abjad is now up and running.

Remember to type just the three letters ``abj`` rather than 
the full five letters in the name of the system.

.. rubric:: Notes

.. [#f1] On Mac OS X you can get a shell prompt using the Terminal application.
   The terminal application lives at ``/Applications/Utilities``. 
   It's probably a good a idea to drag the Terminal application to your dock 
   so that the application is easy to get to and easy to start. 
   Once you've found the Terminal application, click it and type ``abj`` 
   to start Abjad.
