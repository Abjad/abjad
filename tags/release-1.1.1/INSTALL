Install
=======


Dependencies
------------

* Python 2.5 or 2.6
* LilyPond 2.12 or newer

For Abjad to install and run properly, you must already have both Python 2.5 
(or Python 2.6) and LilyPond installed in your computer. Also, make sure that 
both LilyPond and Python are in your *PATH*. To test this simply type 
``lilypond`` and then ``python`` in your command prompt. If both programs run 
then you are good to go. Otherwise you'll have to add the location of the 
executables to your *PATH*.

You can find Python here:
http://www.python.org

and LilyPond here:
http://www.lilypond.org


Installing the official source release
--------------------------------------

Via 'easy_install'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have `setuptools` installed, simply type ``easy_install -U abjad`` in the command prompt of your terminal window. Otherwise...

Manual install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the latest release from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Abjad.

2. Untar the downloaded file (e.g. ``tar xzvf Abjad-NNN.tar.gz``, where 
   ``NNN`` is the version number of the latest release).

3. Change into the directory created in step 2 (e.g. ``cd Abjad-NNN``).

4. If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter the 
   command ``sudo python setup.py install`` at the shell prompt.
   If you're using Windows, start up a command shell with administrator
   privileges and run the command ``setup.py install``.


These commands will install Abjad in your Python installation's 
`site-packages` directory. Note that this requires a working internet 
connection if you don't already have the Python utility 
`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`__ installed.


Note for OS X users
"""""""""""""""""""
In order to be able to run Abjad directly from the terminal via the ``abj`` 
command, you may need to add the python binary installation directory to 
your *PATH*. For example, if you have Python 2.6, ``abj`` would usually be 
placed in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/abj`. Thus, 
you would add `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin` to your 
*PATH*.  

Note for Linux users
""""""""""""""""""""
Abjad makes use of ``xdg-open`` to display PDF files using your default PDF 
viewer.
Most Linux distributions now come with `xdg-utils` installed. If you do not 
have `xdg-utils` installed, download it from 
http://www.portland.freedsektop.org and install it. Alternatively you can 
set the *pdfviewer* variable in the `$HOME/.abjad/config` file to your 
favorite PDF viewer.
