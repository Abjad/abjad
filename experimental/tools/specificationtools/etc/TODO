1.  Change 'beam_cell_together' to 'beam_each_cell'.

2.  Add a notation example to each rhythm-maker API entry.

3.  Reduce this pattern ...
        sixteenths = copy.deepcopy (library.sixteenths)
        sixteenths.beam_cells_together = False
        sixteenths.beam_cell_together = True
    ... to a single method call.

4.  Add more staff-staff space to pitched examples.

5.  Make pitch set tests work for contiguous select expressions.
