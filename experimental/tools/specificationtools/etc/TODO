1.  Reduce this pattern ...
        sixteenths = copy.deepcopy(library.sixteenths)
        sixteenths.beam_cells_together = False
        sixteenths.beam_each_cell = True
    ... to a single method call.

2.  Add more staff-staff space to pitched examples.

3.  Make pitch set tests work for contiguous select expressions.
