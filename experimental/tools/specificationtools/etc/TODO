1.  Unskip all experimental tests before 2.11 build.

2.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division select expressions
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.
    See test_multiple_segment_solo__persistent_overlapping_division_select_expressions_05().

3.  Looks like callback stacks may not be copied over from segment to segment for persistent set expressions.
    Fix test_multiple_segment_solo__persistent_overlapping_division_select_expressions_03() to debug.

4.  Finish timerelationtools class docstrings before 2.11 build.

5.  Finish timespantools package docstrings before 2.11 build.

6.  Add examples to the docstrings of all experimental class methods and properties before 2.11 build.

7.  Move ScoreSpecification.division_region_expressions to VoiceProxy.division_region_expressions.
    Move ScoreSpecification.rhythm_region_expressions to VoiceProxy.rhythm_region_expressions.
