1.  Add use_metrical_hierarcy=False flag to leaftools.make_leaves().
    Integrate into rhythmmakertools.NoteRhythmMaker.

2.  Implement a -1 / +1 talea on TwoStageHairpinHandler to determine
    which stage shoul have greater duration (left or right).

3.  Extend TwoStageHairpinHandler with logic to treat short leaf groups.
    This will enable, for example, the application of left stage
    hairpin to a short two-note group.
