1.  Add a notation example to each rhythm-maker API entry.

2.  Reduce this pattern ...
        sixteenths = copy.deepcopy (library.sixteenths)
        sixteenths.beam_cells_together = False
        sixteenths.beam_cell_together = True
    ... to a single method call.

3.  Add more staff-staff space to pitched examples.

4.  Make pitch set tests work for contiguous select expressions.
