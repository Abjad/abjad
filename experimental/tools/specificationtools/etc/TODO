1.  Implement StatalServerCursorExpression.
    Then replace usage of PayloadExpression with payload of statal server.

2.  Make IterablePayloadExpression.__init__(payload) into __init__(payload=None).
    Same for PayloadExpression.

3.  Extend ScoreSpecification with pitch_set_expressions property.
    Then inspect ScoreSpecification.pitch_set_expressions at pitch interpretation time
    instead of ScoreSpecification.generalized_set_expressions.
    But leave ScoreSpecification.generalized_set_expressions in tact.

4.  Make pitch set tests work for contiguous select expressions.
    Might be fixed as a byproduct of storing ScoreSpecification.pitch_set_expressions.
