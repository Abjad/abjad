1.  Extend ScoreSpecification with pitch_set_expressions property.
    Then inspect ScoreSpecification.pitch_set_expressions at pitch interpretation time
    instead of ScoreSpecification.generalized_set_expressions.
    But leave ScoreSpecification.generalized_set_expressions in tact.

2.  Make pitch set tests work for contiguous select expressions.
    Might be fixed as a byproduct of storing ScoreSpecification.pitch_set_expressions.
