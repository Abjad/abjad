SELECT EXPRESSIONS.


The purpose of this document is to list some of the different types of symbolic selection.
What is a symbolic selection? An indication to pick out a score object at some point
during interpretation. Or an indication to pick out a collection of related score objects.


*ComponentSelectExpression.* Select a single component. What input parameters are available?
First, an optional timepsan defaulting to that of the entire score. Second, an optional
timespan inequality defaulting to the first object that starts during timespan. Then an
arbitrarily long list of ContainerIndicator objects which might eventually be implemented
as a ContainerIndicatorList.

Select the first depth-0 tuplet in the last measure starting during segment 'red':

    select_expression = ComponentSelectExpression(
        timespan=Timespan(klass=Division, name='red'),
        comparator=specificationtools.starts_during_timespan(),
        containment=[
            ContainmentIndicator(klass=Measure, index=-1),
            ContainmentIndicator(klass=Tuplet, index=0, depth=0)]


*SliceSelectExpression.* Select zero or more container elements in sequence. Input parameters?
First, an optional ContainerIndicator defaulting to the entire score. Then, optional
start and stop indices each defaulting to none. The design goal is to mimic the Python
slice interface as closely as possible. So only integer values and none are allowed.
Sequences of named objects like segments will have to be selected some other way.

Select the last three elements of the tuplet picked out above:

    SliceSelectExpression(select_expression, start=-3)

### NOTES ###

* J and K demonstrate that class-restriction and timespan-restriction do not commute.
* L and M demonstrate that slice-restriction and timespan-restriction do not commute.
* N and O demonstrate that slice-restriction and class-restriction do not commute.

We seem to be working with three basic types of restriction:

    1. timespan-restriction (t)
    2. class-restriction (c)
    3. slice-restriction (l)

Note that c() produces a detemporized result.

So, actually, this should mean that application of t() after c() is impossible.
Ie, that c(t()) is allowed but that t(c()) isn't.

This points to a potentially useful limitation on the chaining-together of restrictions.
Timespan-restriction t() operates on temporized input only. This explains why t()
refuses input from c(). Does t() also refuse input from l()? We can't answer the question.
Why? Because we can't make any assumptions about the temporality of the output of l():
it's possible that the output of l() is temporized but it's also possible that the 
output of l() is detemporized. (The output of l(c()) is detemporized whenever the output
of c() is detemporized, for example.) So maybe the useful limitation here is that t()
should apply before everything else. Note too that t() is optional and that t() need
never apply more than one time. So it looks like we have a relatively strong limitation
of the system that says that if t() is going to apply in any chaning-together of restrictions
then t() will apply a single time at the very beginning of the chain.

So maybe what this means is that all component selections are timespan-restricted. In fact,
all component selections always have been timespan-restricted. We just didn't notice the fact
until we got around to modeling timespans explicitly. There is an identity (or null) timespan-
restriction. The identity timespan-restriction simply returns true no matter what the start
and stop points of the objects to which the restriction applies; the identity timespan-
restriction need not even make reference to the timespan of the score. And what this means
is that all selections made in the years of use of the system up until now have been made
with this identity timespan-restriction active by implication.

But also note that timespans are awesome because you can turn any selection into a timespan.
We now observe two things. First that the starting point of every selection is a timespan.
And second that every selection may be changed into a timespan (which may, in turn,
be used as the starting point for yet another selection made in succession).

    * voice 1 top-level components satisfying timespan
    * voice 1 klasses satisfying timespan

I think this also points to a useful limitation on the selection of the component at (x, y, z)
in voice 1. I think if you want to pick out component at (x, y, z) then you have to do that
before any timespan-restriction. Why? Because (x, y, z) is a special thing. The tuple (x, y, z)
is basically something like a "score-tree position" or "score-tree index" or something like that.
Such a score-tree position necessitates the score-tree be in tact. But note that the output of t()
is a list of components. The list of components output by t() is essentially ripped from the 
score tree ("deracinated" or "allolocated", perhaps). So we need a name for the operation
that picks out the component at (x, y, z). We also need to generalize the picking out of the
component at (x, y, z). What does the generalization look like? The generalization picks out
a time-contiguous sequence of components from a voice. The components need not all be top-level.
Call this operation contiguity-restriction and denote it by g().

Is the allowable chaining-together of restrictions then l(c(t(g())))?

Perhaps class-restriction c() generalizes to predicate-restriction p().

Is it then that the allowable chaining together of restrictions is l(p(t(g())))?

### GENERALIZED COMPONENT SELECTION ###

It might suffice to identify g() with thread contiguity. We'll run with that idea.
So then we've got a four-step process to generalize the selection of any component
(or any slice of components) whatever.

(Below we introduce the idea of a noncontext component. What is a noncontext
component? Noncontext components are leaves, tuplets, containers and measures. Noncontext
components make up all the scoretree content that lives a level lower than the voice.)

(Sidenote that this exposes an important principle to be backported to the main codebase.
Thread contiguity should be defined on noncontext components only. No attempt should be
made to evaluate staves nor even voices for thread contiguity. Also it still makes very
good sense to replace 'thread' with 'implicit voice'.)

First g() select thread-contiguous components. Then t() filter by timespan.
Then p() filter by predicate. Then l() index or slice as many times as necessary.

These functions are thread-selection, timespan-restriction, attribute-restriction
and output-slicing, respectively. Perhaps these are not the best names for g(),
t(), p(), l() but they will do for now. Interestingly, these are all basically
different types of restriction that can be placed on the a list of thread-contiguous
components.


### MODELING EVENTLIST RESTRICTION ###

First note that there should be a nonoppositional substitute for "noncontext". We propose
"eventlist component" as a nonoppositional substitute for "noncontext component".

We can then speak of "event-contiguity" in contrast to "time-contiguity". We refer to a 
sequence of components as event-contiguous when all are time-successive components in the same 
implicit voice.

(There's a distinction here to be worked out between event-contiguity, -succession
and -ordering. Which can be done later.)

(This introduces a distinction between time-contiguity and time-succession.
Components c1, ..., cn are time-successive whenever ci.start < cj.start for any i < j.
Components c1, ...., cn are time-contiguous whenever ci.stop == cj.start for any i = j - 1.)

What we're therefore basically looking to do is to say "here's how you select a subsequence of
event-contiguous components."

Denote by e, f two eventstream components in the same stream S with e.start < f.start.
Note that there always exists at least one event-contiguous subsequence of S beginning with e
and ending with f. (Depending on the appearance of nested components there may be more than one 
event-contiguous subsequence of S that begins with e and ends with f. But there will always be at 
least one such subsequence.) Refer to this as the "maximal" subsequence of S beginning with e
and ending with f. Our generalized l(p(t(g()))) component selection procedes from just such a
subsequence of S.

Actually this all becomes massively easier when we notice that for every (implicit) voice v
there exists an eventlist E(v) of all event components in v, given in order of occurrence
during depth-first score traversal.

E(v) is a flat list of components c1, ..., cn such that ci.start <= cj.start for i < j.
(This means that components in the eventlist of v aren't necessarily time-conitugous
or -successive but are always time-ordered by <=.) It is therefore trivial to take any
subsequence of E(v) whatever.

So the act of taking a subsequence of E(v) would be called something like "eventlist
subsequence selection". And it is perhaps just this eventlist subsequence selection
with which our generalized component selection begins.

So then g(), t(), p(), l() are eventlist-restriction, timespan-restriction,
predicate-restriction and output-restriction, respectively.

ALMOST! Not all components in the eventlist are equal for this type of work.
