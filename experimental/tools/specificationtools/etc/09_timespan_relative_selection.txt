TIMESPAN-RELATIVE SELECTION.


One way to select score objects is to index and slice containers.
This has been the case since the beginning of Abjad.
Another way to select score objects is with reference to the
start and stop of objects that may or may not contain each other.
The examples here enumerate selections that follow the new pattern.

We use measure selection with respect to segments as one case of 
object selection with reference an arbitrary timespan.

[Should durated score objects be thought of as intervals or pairs?
Intervals are a powerful generalization of pairs. But we can choose
to think of durated score objects as pairs because all durated score 
objects are understood to be a special type of interval. That is,
all durated score objects and understood to be half-open intervals 
closed on the left.]


### SELECTING MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO SEGMENTS ###

  1 "all measures in 'red'"
    (all m such that red.start <= m.start < m.stop <= red.stop)

  2 "all measures intersecting 'red'"
    (all m such that "red.start <= m.start OR m.stop <= red.stop)

  3 "all measures that start with 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start == red.start)

  4 "all measures that stop with 'red'"
    (all m such that m.stop == red.stop)
 
  5 "all measures in 'red' that start with 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start == red.start AND m.stop <= red.stop)

  6 "all measures in 'red' that stop with 'red'"
    (all m such that red.start <= m.start AND m.stop == red.stop)

  7 "all measures in 'red' that start and stop with red
    (all m such that m.start == red.start AND m.stop == red.stop)

  8 "all measures that overlap the start of 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start < red.start < m.stop)

  9 "all measures that overlap the stop of 'red'"
    (all m such that red.stop < m.stop)

 10 "all measures that overlap both the start and stop of 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start < red.start < red.stop < m.stop)

 11 "all measures that overlap the start of 'red' but not the stop of 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start < red.start < m.stop <= red.stop)

 12 "all measures that both overlap the start of 'red' and stop with 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start < red.start < m.stop == red.stop)

 13 "all measures that overlap the start of 'red' but that stop before 'red'"
    (all m such that m.start < red.start < m.stop < red.stop)

 14 "all measures that overlap the stop of 'red' but not the start of 'red'"
    (all m such that red.start <= m.start < red.stop < m.start)

 15 "all measures that start with 'red' and overlap the stop of 'red'"
    (all m such that red.start == m.start < red.stop < m.start)

[The cases so far all deal with overlap or containment.
The following cases introduce the situations where one timespan abuts another.
There are only two of these.]

  16 "all measures that stop when 'red' starts"
    (all m such that m.stop == red.start)

  17 "all measures that start when 'red' stops"
    (all m such that red.stop == m.start)

[The final cases are those in which the timespans are disjunct.
There are only two of these.]

  18 "measures that stop before red starts
    (all m such that m.stop < red.start)

  19 "measures that start and red starts
    (all m such that red.stop < m.start)

[The cases group into related families according to number of timepoints shared:
    Cases of disjunct timespans (that share no timepoints).
    Cases of timespans that share exactly one timepoint.
    Cases of timespans that share more than one timepoint.]

[Reference. It looks like what's going on in these examples is that one timespan
is being used as a type of "fixed reference" to help pick out sets of other timespans.
In this case one segment is being used to pick out sets of zero or more measures.
This means that there's an implicit idea of something like a "reference timespan".]

STRATEGY: there's some sort of selection process going on here. It looks possible
to model all the cases this process picks out with set-theoretic operations on
on timespan endpoint inequalities.
