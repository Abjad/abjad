1.  Overwrite existing divisions with new divisions:
        divisions = red_segment.select_divisions('Voice 1')[5:10]
        red_segment.set_divisions([(2, 16)], timespan=divisions)
    (Note that overwriting existing time signatures with new time signatures makes no sense.)

2.  Overwrite existing rhythms with new rhythms:
        leaves = red_segment.select_leaves('Voice 1')[5:10]
        red_segment.set_rhythm(library.thirty_seconds, timespan=leaves)
