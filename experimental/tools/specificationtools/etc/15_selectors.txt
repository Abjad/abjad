SELECTORS.


The thinking in the previous doc (14_selectors.txt) goes off course where it tries
to accommodate (x, y, z)-style score-index component selection. Why is this?
I think the reason is because (x, y, z)-style score-index component selection
isn't really composerly. The logic in componenttools.component_to_score_index()
has been in place (and stable) in the system for several years. And in that
time I've never once used the function compositionally. (The function gets
used as a part of other more complicated routines in the system.) So I think
this means that trying to accommodate (x, y, z)-style score-index component
selection up front in the process of generalized component selection is misguided.

What should be fronted in the process of genealized component selection is the
ability to identify any visible component on a page of score with any of the
other items on the page around it. Examples of this are the following:

    * "the last note in measure 46"
    * "the last three notes in measure 46"
    * "everything except the last three notes in measures 45 - 48"
    * "all the toplevel tuplets in measures 45 - 48"
    * "all the notes starting / beginning / ending in timespan t"

There's also a need for a thought-out process of selector reference nesting, too.
In order to say things like "the last rest of the last tuplet starting in segment 'red'".
How much nesting? We can safely leave contexts (like voices, staves, staff groups and scores)
out of the selector reference regime. Why? Because composers reference context components 
by name. Also because context components do not interact with timespan inequalities interestingly.
So our selector reference regime will need to be able to accommodate counttime component
nesting.
