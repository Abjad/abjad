Divisions.

                                    * * *

Example 1. Suppose we have string quartet score S with four staves grouped together,
with a named voice resident in each staff. Suppose S comprises segments T1, T2, T3, T4
and suppose that time signature interpretation yields time signature lists
[(2, 8), (2, 8)], [(3, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8)], [(4, 8), (4, 8), (4, 8)], [(4, 8)],
giving segment durations Duration(4, 8), Duration(9, 8), Duration(12, 8), Duration(4, 8)
for T1, T2, T3, T4, respectively.

It needs to be possible to specify the divisions of S equal to the duration token list
[(3, 8)] read cyclically over the entire duration of S. How should this be specified?
How should the specification interpret?

Such a specification sets the top-level time-divisions of S without regard for the time
signatures of S. A first consequence of this is that the time-divisions of S cross
over the time signature boundaries of S. A second consequence is that the time-divisions 
of S cross over the segment boundaries of S.

The time-divisions of S then equal [(3, 8), (1, 8)+], [+(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8), (1, 8)+],
[+(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8), (1, 8)+] and [+(3, 8), (1, 8)], where + denotes
the continuation of time-division across segment boundaries.

The division-application algorithm we have used is implicitly left-initiated.
Right-initiated application would produce division lists [(2, 8), (2, 8)+], [+(1, 8), 
(3, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)+], [+(1, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)+] and [+(1, 8), (3, 8)] 
instead.

Both left- and right-initiated application yield divisions equal to the durations Duration(4, 8),
Duration(9, 8), Duration(12, 8), Duration(4, 8) of the time signature lists of the segments in S.

We choose to implement left-initiated application in the current version of the system 
and to leave right-initiated application for a future version of the system.

We return to the specification of these divisions of S. What form should such a specification take?

Perhaps simply T1.set_divisions([(3, 8)]) with segment-level context and the persistence
of the set expression implied by the default values of the method's keyword arguments.

How will the specification interpret? Perhaps exactly as shown with the 'open' and 'closed'
divisions of each segment modeled explicitly.

                                    * * *

Example 2. Suppose string quartet score S is specified exactly as above. Then specify that
the violin 1 and viola voices of only T2 override any division specification made at
higher context levels in S and are instead set to equal the total duration of T2 taken
as a single time-division. How should this be specified? How will it interpret?

Perhaps with the addition of only T2.set_divisions([T2.vn2, T2.va], total_segment_duration).

This regime requires that each of the duration specifications in S be processed sequentially,
with the output of each operation attached to all relevant contexts in S after each step.
This is effectively the same as reading lines of code in sequence.

*Division specification.* Division specification admits a greater variety of configuration
than time signature specification. Division specifications are structured the same way
as every other type of specification: that is, as the pair of a target token
together with a source. Further, division specification target tokens take the same form 
as every type of target token: that is, as the triple of a segment name, a list of zero
or more context names, and an optional (horizontal) timespan that acts as type of filter
on all contexts implicated in the selection. Two areas of this model of division specification
require elaboration. The first of these relates to the logical limits attaching to the targets
of division specification. The second must detail the number and type of sources that
division specification admits.

*Targets of division specification.* Suppose segment T comprises time signatures 
[(2, 8), (2, 8), (2, 8)], with total duration Duration(6, 8). The act of specifying divisions
for any of the contexts in T is equivalent to partitioning the (6, 8) of total time
any of the contexts in T consumes. The simplest case obtains in any manifest list of
durations. It is possible, for example, the specify the divisions of the violin 1 voice
in T manifestly equal to the durations [(3, 8), (3, 8)]; such a set expression applies to the
entire duration of the violin 1 voice in T and implies a target selection equal to
the entirety of the violin 1 voice in T. It is more likely to specify the divisions of
the violin 1 voice in T in terms of a callable. (We define a callable equal to any function,
method or callable class with signature that allows, at minimum, for the input of a list of 
durations.) It is, therefore, possible to set the divisions of the violin 1
voice in T equal to the output of callable foo(). In the case that the entirety of the
duration of the violin 1 voice in T is set equal to the output of callable foo(), the
time token list [(2, 8), (2, 8), (2, 8)] will be passed as input to foo(). It is also possible
to set the divisions of only the first two measures of the violin 1 voice in T equal to
the output of foo() while set expression the divisions of the last measure of the violin 1 voice in T
equal to the output bar(); in this case, the time token list [(2, 8), (2, 8)] will be 
passed as input to foo() and the time token list [(2, 8)] will be passed as input to bar().
It is also possible to specify the divisions of duration-partitioned parts of the violin 1
voice in T without reference to the time signatures of T at all. For example, it is possible
to set the divisions of the first [(3, 8)] of the violin 1 voice in T equal to the output of foo()
and the divisions of the last [(3, 8)] of the of the violin 1 voice in T equal to the output of bar(),
in which case the time token list [(3, 8)] will be passed as input to foo() and the duration
list [(3, 8)] will be passed as input to bar(). It is further possible to set the divisions of
the first [(3, 16), (3, 16)] of the violin 1 voice in T equal to the output of foo() and the
divisions of the last [(1, 8), (1, 8), (1, 8)] of the violin 1 voice in T equal to the output
of bar(), in which case the time token list [(3, 16), (3, 16)] will be passed as input to foo()
and the time token list [(1, 8), (1, 8), (1, 8)] will be passed as input to bar().

Division specifications may apply cumulatively for any given context in T. That is, there 
must not be more than one division specification for the violin 1 voice in T. Division
specification Tn for the violin 1 voice in T may specify as complex a partitioned target of
the duration of the violin 1 voice in T as desired; but Tn must then specify sources
(in the form of either manifest values or callables) for each of the parts in the target
selection of Tn. The specification interface might look like this:

measures = segment.select_measures(segment, part=[1, 1, 1])
measures[0](foo)
measures[1](bar)
measures[2](foo)
segment.set_divisions(measures)

Or the specification interface might allow for simple set expression cascades like this:

measures = segment.select_measures(segment, part=[1, 1, 1])
measures(foo)
measures[1](bar)
segment.set_divisions(measures)

We have so far allowed for division specification sources set equal to manifest values or to
callables. We have not yet discussed division specification sources set equal to expressions 
against statal servers. We will do this at some point for this round of implementation.

A third case arises in the possibility of settting a division specification source
equal to a callable specified elsewhere in the score.

A fourth case arises in the possibility of set expression a division specification source
equal to a (potentially indefinitely long) series of actual divisions read (forward or
backward) from any other division elsewhere in the score.

A fifth case arises in the possibility of set expression a division specification source to
a finite series of divisions (to be read cyclically either forward or backward) from any
other context elsewhere in the score.

We leave the current implementation confined to these five different possibilities
for the value of division specification sources.
