TODO

1. Asset instantiation (tested on material proxy instantiation) really does take some time.
   So optimize to make asset instantiation take much less time.
   Possibly by removing all [safe_]imports() from the __init__.py files.
   Best to run the profiler while doing this to avoid unnecessary tinkering.
   Also unnecessarily interpreting output_material.py modules should be elimiated.

2. Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults;
    Implement default_value on user input getter.

3. Fix SCFObject.handle_user_input_with_default() default handling.

4. Define range inventories for all scores.

5. Implement material methods to move material packages from one location to another.

6. Find a way to include tags management in hidden menu of every package proxy.

7. Change 'redraw' to work only on 'r' and 're'.

8. Port output change awareness.

9. Implement something to tour all materials everywhere and inspect in sequence.

10. Make user input handler creation work.

11. Edit instrument transposition.

12. Edit instrument clefs.

13. Remove extra appearance of B-flat clarinet from clarinetist config menu.

14. Change Instrument._default_performer_names to house (full, abbreviation) pairs.

15. Use performer abbreviations to populate performer selection menu.

16. Find a way to dynamically present (default) indicator to default menu entries.

17. Consider keyword backtracking protocol to replace self.push_backtrack() / self.pop_backtrack().

18. Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

19. Change all 'from abc import ABCMeta' to just 'import abc'.

20. Rename scftools to something better.

21. Add ajv test -Z flag to run py.test on all experimental branches *except* scftools.

22. Extend stuff to allow makers to be stored in multiple directories.

23. Extend stuff to allow scores to be stored in multiple directories.
    Then create scftestscores directory somewhere.
    Then check Example Score I, Example Score II, Ã‰tude Score I in to scftestscores.

24. Consolidate scores to single repository.

25. Change curated __init__.py files to load classes automatically.
