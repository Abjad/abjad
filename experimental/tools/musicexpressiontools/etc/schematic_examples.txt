Write D series schematic examples to (re)establish metrical hierarhcy at two
different points.  Establish metrical hierarchy after division specification
and change divisions where necessary.  Reestablish metrical hierarchy after
rhythm specification but leave divisions in tact.

Write E series schematic examples to all focus on different uses of the
metrical hierarchy.  Set divisions equal to different levels of the metrical
hierarchy (beat, next level down, etc.).  Make selections equal to different
levels of the metrical hierarchy.
