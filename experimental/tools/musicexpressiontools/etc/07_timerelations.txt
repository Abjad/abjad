TIMERELATIONS (initial).


(1) BETWEEN TWO TIMEPOINTS. Between arbitrary timepoints u and v exactly three 
timerelations obtain:

    1   u < v       "u precedes v"
    2   u == v      "u and v happen at the same time"
    3   v < u       "v precedes u"

(Where we write "u < v" Xenakis writes "u T v" with infix-T.)


(2) BETWEEN A TIMEPOINT AND A TIMESPAN OF ZERO DURATION. Consider timespan s
with s.start == s.stop. We say that s has zero duration.  Because no timepoint
may intervene between the start and and stop of s the same timerelations that
obtain between timepoints u and v (above) obtain between u and s.


(3) BETWEEN A TIMEPOINT AND A TIMESPAN OF POSITIVE DURATION. Consider timespan
s with s.start < s.stop. We say that s has positive duration.  Between
timepoint u and positive-duration s exactly five timerelations obtain:

    1   u < s                   "u precedes (the start of) s"
    2   u == s.start            "u equals the start of s"
    3   s.start < u < s.stop    "u happens between the start and stop of s"
    4   u == s.stop             "u equals the stop of s"
    5   s < u                   "(the stop of) s precedes u"

Entailment. Certain timerelations imply others. For example, where u precedes s
it is also the case the u precedes both the start and stop of s.

Ambiguity. Other timerelations are specific with regards to the start or stop
of s but not with regards to both the start and stop of s. For example, where
we state only that u precedes the stop of s the relation between u and the
start of s can not be determined.

Intermediacy. The preposition "during" is problematic. Where s.start < u <
s.stop it is clear that u happens during s. But where u == s.start or where u
== s.stop it is not clear whether u happens during s or not.
