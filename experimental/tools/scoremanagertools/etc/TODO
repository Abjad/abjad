1.  Edit instrument transposition.

2.  Edit instrument clefs.

3.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults.
    Implement default value on user input getter.

4.  Fix ScoreManagerObject.handle_user_input_with_default() default handling.

5.  Define range inventories for all scores.

6.  Make user input handler creation work.

7.  Find a way dynamcially to present default indicator 
    with default menu entries.

8.  Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

9.  Implement something to tour all materials everywhere 
    and examine in sequence.

10. Currently MaterialPackageMaker inherits from MaterialPackageManager.
    Maybe MaterialPackageMaker should *have* a MaterialPackageManager instead.
    This would clean up the inheritance schema somewhat.

11. Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

12. Add a top-level test directory to every score package directory.
    Then add a score/test/test_import_score.py file.
    The file will test 'import red_example_score', 
    'import green_example_score', and so on.

13. Implement example_score_i.materials.divisions to import 
    example_score_i.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.
    Implement example_score_ii.materials.divisions to 
    import example_score_i.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an interpackage material import.

14. Replace all _read_only_attributes.py and _public_attributes.py 
    test files with doctests.

15. Sweep inline scoremanagertools TODO items.

16. Author ScorePackageManager docstrings.

17. Add PackageystemAssetManager to superclass ModuleManager and 
    PackageManager.

18. Create a PackagesystemAssetManager to parallel PacakagesystemAssetWrangler.

19. Harmonize user input strings with method names in 
    MaterialPackageManager.user_input_to_action dictionary.

20. Author StylesheetFileWrangler.interactively_remove_assets() test.
    Will involve making pending_user_input='... rm ...' work with named 
    arguments instead of just numeric arguments.

21. Make MaterialPackageMaker classes stop creating materials in 
    tools.scoremanagertools.materialpackages.
    Those classes should create material packages in the user asset 
    library material packages directory.
    Or in user score packages. But no material packages should ever 
    be created in the built-in asset library material packages directory.

22. Implement material methods to move material packages 
    from one location to another.

23. Find a way to include metadata management in hidden menu 
    of every package manager.

24. Implement a menuing decorator in decoratortools.
    Then integrate against all classes.

24. Finish the docstrings for all io classes.

25. Refactor iotools as a single IOManager class.

26. Make scoremanagertools.iotools.IOManager inherit from iotools.IOManager.

27. Audit all '*_file_name' variables in the system.
    Most are probably file path variables and should be renamed.
    Just run "abjad-ack _file_name" and inspect the output
    for score manager source files.

28. Beautify the code all of score manager and music expression test files.

29. Refactor scoremanagertools.editors to contain as few classes as possible.

30. Refactor score manager wizard classes to use instance attributes in place
    of class attributes.

31. Refactor score manager material package maker classes to instance
    attributes in place of class attributes.

32. Implement a Session.display_variables() method to print the current value
    of all session variables to the terminal for user inspection.

33. Figure out the correct ajv replace regex to change tratiettor/music
    to just traiettorie.

34. Find a way to get rid of the ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        segment = Segment()
        lilypond_file = segment()
        current_directory_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        iotools.log_render_lilypond_input(
            lilypond_file,
            output_directory_path=current_directory_path,
            output_file_name_root='output',
            )

    ... at the bottom of each segment definition file.
    There should be a way to call a prebuilt external script
    that does exactly the same thing.

35. Bug exists when making handmade material packages.
    Create the packge. Then [mde] to edit the material definition module.
    The last line in file reads like this:
        /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/temporary/materials/foo = None
