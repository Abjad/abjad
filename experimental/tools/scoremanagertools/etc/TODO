1.  Something takes a bunch of time. So optimize to make stuff take much less time.
    Possibly by removing unnecessary output_material.py module interpretation.
    Also possibly by removing all [safe_]imports() from the __init__.py files.
    First run profiler to avoid unnecessary tinkering.

2.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults;
    Implement default_value on user input getter.

3.  Fix ScoreManagerObject.handle_user_input_with_default() default handling.

4.  Define range inventories for all scores.

5.  Implement material methods to move material packages from one location to another.

6.  Find a way to include tags management in hidden menu of every package proxy.

7.  Port output change awareness.

8.  Implement something to tour all materials everywhere and examine in sequence.

9.  Make user input handler creation work.

10. Edit instrument transposition.

11. Edit instrument clefs.

12. Remove extra appearance of B-flat clarinet from clarinetist config menu.

13. Change Instrument._default_performer_names to house (full, abbreviation) pairs.

14. Use performer abbreviations to populate performer selection menu.

15. Find a way to dynamically present (default) indicator to default menu entries.

16. Consider keyword backtracking protocol to replace self.push_backtrack() / self.pop_backtrack().

17. Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

18. Consolidate scores to single repository.

19. Add a scores/test directory and check it into the scores repository.
    Then add a scores/test/test_scores_import_scores.py file.
    The file will test 'import example_score_1', 'import example_score_2', etc.
    This will be a very high-level test to make sure that entire score packages remain importable.

20. Extend stuff to allow makers to be stored in multiple directories.

21. Extend stuff to allow scores to be stored in multiple directories.
    Then create scoremanagertoolstestscores directory somewhere.
    Then check Example Score I, Example Score II, Étude Score I in to directory.

22. Simplify custom_score/mus/materials/__init__.py files.
    File should probably contain nothing.
    What is the design goal?
    The design goal is that the score manager should always start.
    The score manager should start even when a score directory contains explosively bad code.
    This means that the score manager should basically import no code.
    If the user requests explicit import then the score manager should use safe import.
    Ultimately this should mean that safe_import() can be removed from *all* __init__.py files everywhere.
    The system might preserve safe_import() to be used in direct response to user request for explicit import.

23. Implement example_score_i.mus.materials.divisions to import example_score_i.mus.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.
    Implement example_score_ii.mus.materials.divisions to import example_score_i.mus.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an interpackage material import.

24. Remove the has_readable_... and is_readable_... properties from the system entirely.
    Force such functionality to be method calls that will be noticeably expensive.

25. Migrate all build_illustration.py modules from separate modules to bound class methods.

26. Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

27. Audit all __init__.py files and make all autoloading.

28. Reimplement 'is_versioned' to look for the presence of hidden .svn directory. Maybe?

29. Move experimental/materials to scoremanagertools/materials.
    move experimental/specifiers to scoremanagertools/specifiers.

30. Change 'chunks' globally to 'segments'.

31. Move ScoreManagerObject.package_path_to_directory_path() to ScoreManagerConfiguration.
    Then see if it's possible to change ...
        class PackageProxy(DirectoryProxy, ImportableAssetProxy, ScoreManagerObject)
    ... to ...
        class PackageProxy(DirectoryProxy, ImportableAssetProxy)
    ... instead.

32. Encapsulate the stuff in ScoreManagerObject in newly implemented class.
    Then include a reference to the class (perhaps as a class attribute) in ScoreManagerObject by composition.

33. Rename stringtools.strict_to_strict_directory_name() to something without 'directory'.
    The function is used to strip nonascii things. Maybe better to use that.

34. Move ScoreManagerObject.change_string_to_human_readable_string() to stringtools.
    Rename to something better when doing this.

35. Audit for os.path.sep and replace with better os module functions.

36. Fix AssetWrangler.__repr__ and ScorePackageWrangler.__repr__.
    Write a generalized script to test the reprs of all objects in the system.

37. Make Session no longer inherit from ScoreManagerObject. Maybe?

38. Remove Session.transcript.
    Change Session.complete_transcript to Session.transcript.
    Remove concept of 'short transcript' altogether.

39. Remove 'for path in self.list_*' from AssetWrangler.
