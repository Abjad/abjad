TIMESPAN RELATIONS.

This document revises #10 before it.

A reference timespan t and and a "movable" timespan s together define four timepoints.
There are t.start, t.stop, s.start and s.stop. And we may choose to abbreviate these X, Y
(for reference timespan t) and A, B (for movable timespan s). Regardless of labeling,
two timespans define four timepoints.

Perhaps the ultimate question to is ask is what set of natural language API
functions best capture the various relationships that obtain between s and t?
Linguistic notions like "all the timespans s that start before t starts" and
"all the timespans s that share exactly one timepoint with t" are the goal.
But there's no hope of getting there if there formalization isn't clear.

So what's the formalization?

We must first make decisions about zero-length timespans. Do we allow them or not?
On the one hand, the most intuitive cases all make reference to timespans with positive
duration. On the other hand, hard-won experience suggests that zero-duration whatevers
will eventually make themselves useful. Additionally, prelimiary sketches from the last
couple of days' work suggest that the cases of positively durated timespans are actually
trickier to work out that the case that allows for zero-duration timespans.

At any rate, we make the decision here to enumerate cases for positively durated timespans only.

And with that we are now in a position to procede.

* * *

We recall that two timespans define four timepoints, which we label X, Y (reference) 
and A, B (movable). In the most basic case this means that we've got four objects. And
it also means that we can be certain we can characterize all possible relationships obtaining
between s and t if we can exhaustively characterize the relationships obtaining between
these four objects.

So our insistence on positively durated timespans s, t then provides us with something
very useful. By definition, s.start < s.stop and t.start < t.stop or, equivalently,
A < B and X < Y.

Why does this matter? It matters because in the exhaustive enumeration that we're about
to undertake, we will repeatedly inquire as to the relationship(s) obtaining between
two or more timepoints. And our upfront restrictions that A < B and X < Y means that
everytime we ask about the relationship between A and B or between X and Y we will
have a context-free answer ready-made.

So:

We begin by observing that all of the cases that we are interested in relate A, B
to X, Y  in some way. Why? Because we are free to make observations about A, B in 
isolation all day. But unless or until we observe something about A, B *in relation to*
X, Y we are not yet answering the question of how two different timespans relate.

So we start at the beginning and proceded, perhaps bizarrely, by dialetic questioning:

Does it make sense to let A < X. Yes, it absolutely does. That criterion (or inequality)
taken all by itself picks out an enormously important set of timespans. If we think
of reference timespan t as a (probably large) segment and think of movable timespan
timespan s as a (probably smaller) measure, then the restriction that A < X picks out
the set of all measures that start before segment t starts.

Then: with A < X fixed we should consider B (ie, s.stop). If A is fixed prior to X,
does it make sense to consider the time-relative positioning of B at all? Indeed it does.
It is completely unnecessary to consider the relationship between A and B because our
insistence on positively durated timespans guarantees that A < B. What about considering
the relationships that may obtain between B and X? We find that it is of no use at all
to consider the cases where B < X when we have already decided that A < X. Why?
Because we insist that A < B (ie, that our movable measure have a positive duration).
And so it is absolutely redudant to declare that A < X if we then go on to declare
that B < X. Looked at another way, it is a very significant thing indeed to declare
that B < X because this one criterion alone picks out the set of, for example, all
measures that stop before a certain segment begins. So if we declare that we're
interested in the set of measures that obtain when both A < X and B < X we are
then being redundant. It is clearly enough to declare only that B < X and to move on.

So we return to the basic proposition that A < X. To write "A < X && B < X" is redudant,
as shown above. So we do not do this. We move B somewhat to the right and consider the
cases where B == X. Does is make sense to write "A < X && B == X"? No. Because A < B
the statement that B == X entails A < X. So the compound assertion "A < X && B == X"
is redundant. So we avoid writing this. Then we move B somewhat further to the right
and consider the cases where X < B. Does it make sense to write "A < X < B"? Definitely.
This expression denotes an enormously important set of cases of, for examples, measures
that overlap the start of some segment. Let us move B even further to the right and
consider the cases in which B == Y. Does it make sense to write "A < X and B == Y".
Absolutely. This expression captures, for example, those measures that start before
a certain segment but share an endpoint with it. We move B one position even further
to the right and inquire as to the cases in which Y < B. Does it make sense to write
"A < X and Y < B". Absolutely. The notion captures the set of (perhaps very large) measures
that cover our reference segment completely.

Our investigation yields.

So far we have unearthed the following inequalities and tested each for both
relevance and redundancy:

    A < X               "the set of measures that begin before segment blah"
    A < X < B           "the set of measures that overlap the start of segment blah"
    A < X && B == Y     "the set of measures that overlap the start of segment blah but end with it"
    A < X && Y < B      "the set of measures that overlap both the start and stop of segment blah"

We can definitely procede this way.

* * *

The next set of cases will depend on moving A to the right such that A == X. This inequality
itself picks out an enormously important set of cases of, for example, all measures that
start at the same time as an arbitrary reference segment.

What remains to be done now is to move B through the various positions it can take
with respect to A, X, Y and evaluate the relevance and redundancy B provides in those positions.
