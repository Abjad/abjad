TIMESPAN RELATIONS.

This document revises #10 before it.

A reference timespan t and and a "movable" timespan s together define four timepoints.
There are t.start, t.stop, s.start and s.stop. And we may choose to abbreviate these X, Y
(for reference timespan t) and A, B (for movable timespan s). Regardless of labeling,
two timespans define four timepoints.

Perhaps the ultimate question to is ask is what set of natural language API
functions best capture the various relationships that obtain between s and t?
Linguistic notions like "all the timespans s that start before t starts" and
"all the timespans s that share exactly one timepoint with t" are the goal.
But there's no hope of getting there if there formalization isn't clear.

So what's the formalization?

We must first make decisions about zero-length timespans. Do we allow them or not?
On the one hand, the most intuitive cases all make reference to timespans with positive
duration. On the other hand, hard-won experience suggests that zero-duration whatevers
will eventually make themselves useful. Additionally, prelimiary sketches from the last
couple of days' work suggest that the cases of positively durated timespans are actually
trickier to work out that the case that allows for zero-duration timespans.

At any rate, we make the decision here to enumerate cases for positively durated timespans only.

And with that we are now in a position to procede.

* * *

We recall that two timespans define four timepoints, which we label X, Y (reference) 
and A, B (movable). In the most basic case this means that we've got four objects. And
it also means that we can be certain we can characterize all possible relationships obtaining
between s and t if we can exhaustively characterize the relationships obtaining between
these four objects.

So our insistence on positively durated timespans s, t then provides us with something
very useful. By definition, s.start < s.stop and t.start < t.stop or, equivalently,
A < B and X < Y.

Why does this matter? It matters because in the exhaustive enumeration that we're about
to undertake, we will repeatedly inquire as to the relationship(s) obtaining between
two or more timepoints. And our upfront restrictions that A < B and X < Y means that
everytime we ask about the relationship between A and B or between X and Y we will
have a context-free answer ready-made.

So:

We begin by observing that all of the cases that we are interested in relate A, B
to X, Y  in some way. Why? Because we are free to make observations about A, B in 
isolation all day. But unless or until we observe something about A, B *in relation to*
X, Y we are not yet answering the question of how two different timespans relate.

So we start at the beginning and proceded, perhaps bizarrely, by dialetic questioning:

Does it make sense to let A < X. Yes, it absolutely does. That criterion (or inequality)
taken all by itself picks out an enormously important set of timespans. If we think
of reference timespan t as a (probably large) segment and think of movable timespan
timespan s as a (probably smaller) measure, then the restriction that A < X picks out
the set of all measures that start before segment t starts.

Then: with A < X fixed we should consider B (ie, s.stop). If A is fixed prior to X,
does it make sense to consider the time-relative positioning of B at all? Indeed it does.
This gives the first of the inequalities we will record:

  [1] A < X             "measures that begin before segment blah"

It is completely unnecessary to consider the relationship between A and B because our
insistence on positively durated timespans guarantees that A < B. What about considering
the relationships that may obtain between B and X? Three timerelations obtain
between any two timepoints. Between B and X these are B < X, B == X, and X < B.
We find that it is of no use at all to consider the cases where B < X when we have 
already decided that A < X. Why?
Because we insist that A < B (ie, that our movable measure have a positive duration).
And so it is absolutely redudant to declare that A < X if we then go on to declare
that B < X. Looked at another way, it is a very significant thing indeed to declare
that B < X because this one criterion alone picks out the set of, for example, all
measures that stop before a certain segment begins. So if we declare that we're
interested in the set of measures that obtain when both A < X and B < X we are
then being redundant. It is clearly enough to declare only that B < X and to move on.

So we return to the basic proposition that A < X. To write "A < X && B < X" is redudant,
as shown above. So we do not do this. We procede to the next relation that may obtain
between B and X, namely B == X.  Does is make sense to write "A < X && B == X"? No. 
Because A < B the statement that B == X entails A < X. So the compound assertion "A < X && B == X"
is redundant. So we avoid writing this. We procede to the next relation that may obtain
between B and X, namely X < B. Does it make sense to write "A < X && X < B"? Definitely.
This expression denotes an enormously important set of cases of, for examples, measures
that overlap the start of some segment. So we have garnered the second of our inequalities:
    
  [2] A < X && X < B      "measures that overlap the start of segment blah"

So far we have fixed A < X and then considered the three relations that may obtain
between B and X. What if we continue to fix A < X and consider the relations that
may obtain between B and Y? These are B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B. We consider each in turn.
Does it make sense to write "A < X && B < Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write
"A < X && B == Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write "A < X && Y < B"? Yes. We have
garnered three further inequalities:

  [3] A < X && B < Y      "measures that start before blah starts and end before blah ends"
  [4] A < X && B == Y     "measures that start before blah starts and end when blah ends"
  [5] A < X && Y < B      "measures that start before blah starts and end after blah ends"

So we are still considering cases where the primary assertion is that A < X. So far we 
have let B vary with respect to X. And we have also let B vary with respect to Y.
Are there cases where it makes sense to let B vary with both X and Y? That is, does
it make sense to combine "A < X && X < B" with any of the three inequalities listed
immediately above? We consider each in turn. Does it makes sense to write
"A < X && X < B && A < X && B < Y"? This simplifies to "A < X && X < B && B < Y".
Does this make sense? Yes. Does it make sense to write "A < X && X < B && A < X && B == Y"?
This simplifies to "A < X && X < B && B == Y". This reduces to "A < X && B == Y" which
is redundant with any entry already on our list. Finally, does it make sense to
write "A < X && X < B && A < X && Y < B"? This simplifies to "A < X && X < B && Y < B".
This is redundant with "A < X && Y < B" which is redundant with an entry already on our list.
So there are no cases where it makes sense to let B vary with both X and Y. This yields
no additional inequalities for our list.

* * *

The next set of cases will depend on moving A to the right such that A == X. This inequality
itself picks out an enormously important set of cases of, for example, all measures that
start at the same time as an arbitrary reference segment.

  [6] A == X            "measures that start when blah starts"

What remains to be done now is to move B through the various positions it can take
with respect to A, X, Y and evaluate the relevance and redundancy B provides in those positions.

So we assert that A == X. What other restrictions make sense together with A == X?
Consider B. Does it make sense to position B with respect to A? No because we state
up front that A < B in all cases. Then does it make sense to position B with respect to X?
Three possible relations obtain between any two timepoints. So between B and X three relations
are possible. We examine each to find which of the three make sense. When A == X does it make
sense to write "A == X && B < X"? No. This is impossible. We move B to the right and ask
if it makes sense to write "A == X && B == X". This too is impossible. We move B further
to the right and ask whether it makes sense to write "A == X && X < B". No, this is redundant.
We have not considered the three relationships possible between X and B. Those are that B
precede X, that B equal X, and that B follow X. When we assert A == X and A < B, none of these
three relations between X and B make sense.

We continue to assert that A == X. And we continue to consider B. Does it make sense to
position B with respect to Y? Three relations are possible between any two timepoints.
These are B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B. We consider each in turn together with A == X.
Does it make sense to write "A == X && B < Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write
"A == X && B == Y". Again yes. Does it make sense to write "A == X && Y < B"? Yes.
So we have garnered three new compound inequalitites:

  [7] A == X && B < Y     "measures that start with segment blah but end before segment blah"
  [8] A == X && B == Y    "measures that start and stop with segment blah"
  [9] A == X && Y < B     "measures that start with segment blah and overlap the end of blah"

* * *

Now we move A further to the right and ask whether it makes sense to assert X < A. Indeed it does.
These are, for example, the measures that start after segment blah starts.

 [10] X < A                 "measures that start after blah starts"

Now, given X < A, what other restrictions make sense?

Does it make sense to compare A to B? No because we know that A < B.

Does it make sense to compare A to Y? In fact it does. Three timerelations obtain
between any three timepoints. Between A and Y these are A < Y, A == Y, and Y < A.
With X < A, we consider each of these three relations in turn. Does it make sense
to write "X < A && A < Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write "X < A && A == Y"? No.
Does it make sense to write "X < A && Y < A"? No. This is impossible. So we have
garnered one new inequality:

 [11] X < A && A < Y     "measures that start after segment blah starts but before segment blah stops"

Still with X < A, does it make sense to compare B to Y? Three timerelations are possible.
These are B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B. We consider each in turn with X < A. Does it make sense
to write "X < A && B < Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write "X < A && B == Y"? Yes. Does it
make sense to write "X < A && Y < B"? Yes. We have garnered three new inequalitites:

 [12] X < A && B < Y      "measures that start after blah starts and stop before blah stops"
 [13] X < A && B == Y     "measures that start after blah starts and stop when blah stops"
 [14] X < A && Y < B      "measures that start after blah starts and stop and after blah stops"

So far with X < A, we have enumerated four different compound inequalities, as shown above.
Does it make sense to combine the first of these four inequalities (X < A && A < Y) with
any of the three other such inequalities? We consider each of the three cases in turn.
To write "X < A && A < Y" together with "X < A && B < Y" we can simplify to
"X < A && A < Y && B < Y". Does this make sense? It makes sense but is redundant. Why?
Because the A < Y clause is entailed in the other two clauses. That is, the statement
"X < A && A < Y && B < Y" simplifies to "X < A && B < Y", which is already on our list, above.
Does it make sense to write "X < A && A < Y && B == Y"? It is redundant and simplifies to
"X < A && B == Y", which is already on our list, above. Does it make sense to write
"X < A && A < Y && Y < B"? Yes, it does. We have garnered one new compound inequality:

 [15] X < A && A < Y && Y < B "measures that start after blah starts and overlap the stop of blah"

* * *

We've now exhaustively considered the cases built on the three relations possible between A and X.
These are A < X, A == X, and X < A. During this process we've enumerated the following:

  [1] A < X                     "measures that begin before segment blah"
  [2] A < X && X < B            "measures that overlap the start of segment blah"
  [3] A < X && B < Y            "measures that start before blah starts and end before blah ends"
  [4] A < X && B == Y           "measures that start before blah starts and end when blah ends"
  [5] A < X && Y < B            "measures that start before blah starts and end after blah ends"
  [6] A == X                    "measures that start when blah starts"
  [7] A == X && B < Y           "measures that start with segment blah but end before segment blah"
  [8] A == X && B == Y          "measures that start and stop with segment blah"
  [9] A == X && Y < B           "measures that start with segment blah and overlap the end of blah"
 [10] X < A                     "measures that start after blah starts" 
 [11] X < A && A < Y            "measures that start after segment blah starts but before segment blah stops"
 [12] X < A && B < Y            "measures that start after blah starts and stop before blah stops"
 [13] X < A && B == Y           "measures that start after blah starts and stop when blah stops"
 [14] X < A && Y < B            "measures that start after blah starts and stop and after blah stops"
 [15] X < A && A < Y && Y < B   "measures that start after blah starts and overlap the stop of blah"

We must now ask after the relations that obtain between A and Y. These are A < Y, A == Y, and Y < A.
All of these are valid. Though these three cases will combine with restrictions on B and X to produce
fewer compound inequalities than those enumerated so far.

* * *

Each of the relations between A and Y is valid in isolation. Each is a simple inequality.
We add each to our list:

 [16] A < Y                     "measures that start before blah stops"
 [17] A == Y                    "measures that start when blah stops"
 [18] Y < A                     "measures that start after blah stops"

We next consider each of these simple restrictions between A and Y in turn and ask what
other restrictions make sense together with these.

We start with A < Y. In relation to which other timepoints can we locate A? The timerelation
between A and B is fixed at A < B. And we considered all three of the timerelations 
obtaining between A and X above. (Additionally, the three timerelations between A and Y
imply timerelations between A and X exactly: relating A to Y renders it absolutely redundant
to then relate A to X.) What about relating B to X? The three relations are B < X, B == X,
and X < B. We consider each in turn together with A < Y. Does it make sense to write
"A < Y && B < X"? Redundant because it is enough to assert only that B < X. So we will acquire
this simple inequality later when we consider the timerelations obtaining between B and
the other timepoints in our configuration. Does it make sense to write "A < Y && B == X"?
Redundant because B == X is enough. Does it make sense to write "A < Y && X < B"? Redundant
because X < B is enough. So A < Y does not combine effectively with B < X, B == X, or X < B.
What about the timerelations obtaining between B and Y? They are B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B.
We consider each in turn with A < Y. Does it make sense to write "A < Y && B < Y"? Redundant
because B < Y is enough. Does it make sense to write "A < Y && B == Y"? Redundant because
B == Y is enough. Does it make sense to write "A < Y && Y < B". Yes. That's a compound inequality
that picks out a completely novel set of timespans. We add it to our list:

 [19] A < Y && Y < B            "measures that overlap the stop of blah"

Our consideration of A < Y in combination with all other timerelations yielded only
single composite inequality given immediately above.

We now turn to A == Y. We write no compositie inequalities with A == Y because A == Y
implies X < A, X < B, and Y < B.

We then turn to Y < A. This implies X < A, X < B, and Y < B. For this reason we write
no composite inequalities with Y < A.

We've now considered all three relations A < Y, A == Y, and Y < A obtaining between A and Y.

* * *

Consider the fourth of our six timepoint 2-sets. This is {B, X}. The three relations possible
between B and X are B < X, B == X, and X < B. All three pick out important timespan configurations.
We add all three inequalities to our list:

 [20] B < X                     "measures that stop before blah starts"
 [21] B == X                    "measures that stop when blah starts"
 [22] X < B                     "measures that stop after blah starts"

Does B < X compound? It is clear that B < X implies A < X, A < Y, and B < Y. So we write
no compound inequalitites with B < X.

Does B == X compound? It is clear that B == X implies A < X, A < Y, and B < Y. So we write
no compound inequalities with B == X. 

Does X < B compound? It is clear that X < B fixes the timerelations obtaining between 
neither {A, X} nor {A, Y} nor {B, Y}. So we consider X < B in combination with arrangements 
of the timepoints in each of the these 2-sets in turn.

The three timerelations obtaining between A and X are A < X, A == X, and X < A. We've examined
each of these before. But let's see what happens when we combine these with X < B.
Does it make sense to write "X < B && A < X". Yes but this is equivalent to "A < X && X < B",
which is already on our list. Does it make sense to write "X < B && A == X"? Redundant because
A == X is enough. Does it make sense to write "X < B && X < A"? Redundant because X < A is enough.

We combine X < B with A < Y, A == Y, and Y < A. But we have evaluated each of the realtions
obtaining between A and Y before. So all such combinations with X < B will be redundant.

We combine X < B with B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B. Because we have not yet examined the relations
obtaining between B and Y it is possible that these will yield novel inequalities.
Does it make sense to write "X < B && B < Y"? Yes. Does it make sense to write "X < B && B == Y"?
Redundant because this simplifies to B == Y. Does it make sense to write "X < B && Y < B"?
Redundant because this simplifies to Y < B. So we have garnered one new inequality:

 [23] X < B && B < Y            "measures that stop after blah starts but before blah stops"

We've now considered {B, X} exhaustively.

We next consider {B, Y}.

Three timerelations obtain between B and Y. These are B < Y, B == Y, and Y < B. All three 
pick out important timespan configurations. We add all three to our list:

 [24] B < Y                     "measures that stop before blah stops"
 [25] B == Y                    "measures that stop when blah stops"
 [26] Y < B                     "measures that stop after blah stops"

We have now considered {A, X}, {A, Y}, {B, X} and {B, Y} exhaustively. These are the four
timepoint 2-sets we allow to vary (because we do not allow (A, B) or (X, Y) to vary). And
because we considered these four categories in order there is no point in reexamining 
the three variable categories {A, X}, {A, Y}, {B, X} that precede {B, Y}.

The complete enumeration follows.

  [1] A < X                     "measures that begin before segment blah"
  [2] A < X && X < B            "measures that overlap the start of segment blah"
  [3] A < X && B < Y            "measures that start before blah starts and end before blah ends"
  [4] A < X && B == Y           "measures that start before blah starts and end when blah ends"
  [5] A < X && Y < B            "measures that start before blah starts and end after blah ends"
  [6] A == X                    "measures that start when blah starts"
  [7] A == X && B < Y           "measures that start with segment blah but end before segment blah"
  [8] A == X && B == Y          "measures that start and stop with segment blah"
  [9] A == X && Y < B           "measures that start with segment blah and overlap the end of blah"
 [10] X < A                     "measures that start after blah starts"
 [11] X < A && A < Y            "measures that start after segment blah starts but before segment blah stops"
 [12] X < A && B < Y            "measures that start after blah starts and stop before blah stops"
 [13] X < A && B == Y           "measures that start after blah starts and stop when blah stops"
 [14] X < A && Y < B            "measures that start after blah starts and stop and after blah stops"
 [15] X < A && A < Y && Y < B   "measures that start after blah starts and overlap the stop of blah"
 [16] A < Y                     "measures that start before blah stops"
 [17] A == Y                    "measures that start when blah stops"
 [18] Y < A                     "measures that start after blah stops"
 [19] A < Y && Y < B            "measures that overlap the stop of blah"
 [20] B < X                     "measures that stop before blah starts"
 [21] B == X                    "measures that stop when blah starts"
 [22] X < B                     "measures that stop after blah starts"
 [23] X < B && B < Y            "measures that stop after blah starts but before blah stops"
 [24] B < Y                     "measures that stop before blah stops"
 [25] B == Y                    "measures that stop when blah stops"
 [26] Y < B                     "measures that stop after blah stops"
