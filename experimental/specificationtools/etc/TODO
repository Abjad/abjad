1. Rename TemporalScope to Timespan. This gives setting.target.timespan for access.

2. Possibly rename TemporalCursor to ObjectRelativeTimepoint?

3. Change 'attribute_name' to 'attribute' everywhere because there is not Attribute object.

8. Implement selection-creation courtesy methods.

9. Implement timespan-creation courtesy methods.
    First one: self.segment_name_to_timespan(segment_name).
