1. Revive TemporalCursor class. Use as infinitely thin cursor.
   TemporalCursor will comprise segment, context, klass, index.
   Alternatively, TemporalCursor will comprise segment, offset.
   No need for boundary condition; other classes will model boundary conditions.

2. Refactor TemporalScope with start moment indiator and stop moment indicator.

3. Make Setting inherit from Directive. Or vice versa. Or make both inherit from an ABC.

4. Implement RetrievalRequest as base class for different retrieval requests classes.
