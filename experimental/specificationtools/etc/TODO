1.  Reimplement all get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset() pairs
    in terms of a single get_score_offsets() method.

2.  Integrate timespan inequality filtering into all inequality selector classes.

3.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

4.  Extend markuptools.make_centered_title_markup() with optional single_line=True keyword.
    Then set to false in helpertools.write_test_output() and rerender all test collateral.

5.  Notice that the SegmentSpecification.set_divisions() 'truncate' keyword means two things.
    It means truncate last division in section. It also means restart divisions at
    beginning of following section. Implement a SegmentSpecification.set_divisions()
    boolean 'restart' keyword to separate these functions. When restart=True
    then truncate will always effectively be interpreted as true.
