A.  Extend SegmentSpecification.set_rhythm() to accept parseable rhythm string input.

1.  Remove all references to T1, T2.

2.  Reimplement exemplum [X3] using division material requests instead
    of rhythm material requests.

3.  Reimplement all get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset() pairs
    in terms of a single get_score_offsets() method.

4.  Integrate timespan inequality filtering into all inequality selector classes.

5.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

6.  Extend markuptools.make_centered_title_markup() with optional single_line=True keyword.
    Then set to false in helpertools.write_test_output() and rerender all test collateral.

7.  Notice that the SegmentSpecification.set_divisions() 'truncate' keyword means two things.
    It means truncate last division in section. It also means restart divisions at
    beginning of following section. Implement a SegmentSpecification.set_divisions()
    boolean 'restart' keyword to separate these functions. When restart=True
    then truncate will always effectively be interpreted as true.

8.  Explain beam spanner function in beam spanner doc strings.
    Change 'span' keyword to 'span_beam_count'.
    Change 'lone' keyword to something self-documenting.
    Change 'Complex' in ComplexBeamSpanner, DuratedComplexBeamSpanner, MeasuredComplexBeamSpanner
    to something self-documenting; this will mean renaming all three classes.
    Generalize MeasureComplexBeamSpanner to something that will handle arbitrary objects
    (and not just measures). 
    Clean up docstrings for all beamtools classes and functions.
    Write a tutorial clearly explaining beam spanner types.

9.  Rename all occurrences of (note value) 'signal' to 'talea'.

10. Rename all occurrences of 'time-token maker' to 'rhythm maker'.

11. Change all occurrences of 'duration tokens' (in timetokentools) to 'time tokens'.

12. Remove all occurrences of 'duration token' from the mainline.
    Check that coercion is implemented pervasively instead.

13. Extend tuplettools.make_tuplet_from_duration_and_proportions() to coererce duration argument.

14. Change 'proportions' to 'ratio' everywhere in tuplettools API.

15. Extend OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.rotate() with a new 'level=-1' keyword.
    The keyword will specify the score-tree level at which rotation should happen.

16. Change 'beam' to 'beam_cells_together' in rhythm library.
