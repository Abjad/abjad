1.  Reimplement all get_start_offset() and get_stop_offset() pairs
    in terms of a single get_offsets() method.

2.  Integrate timespan inequality filtering into all inequality selector classes.

3.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

4.  Notice that the SegmentSpecification.set_divisions() 'truncate' keyword means two things.
    It means truncate last division in section. It also means restart divisions at
    beginning of following section. Implement a SegmentSpecification.set_divisions()
    boolean 'restart' keyword to separate these functions. When restart=True
    then truncate will always effectively be interpreted as true.

5.  Extend OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.rotate() with a new 'level=-1' keyword.
    The keyword will specify the score-tree level at which rotation should happen.
    The keyword will be an attribute of the RotationIndicator class.

6.  Implement SegmentSpecification.select_multiple_divisions() to return multiple
    selectors at once. This will change ...
        first_division = red_segment.select_division(0)
        second_division = red_segment.select_division(1)
        third_division = red_segment.select_division(2)
    ... into this ...
        first_division, second_division, third_division = red_segment.select_all_divisions()
    ... instead.

7.  Implement very basic cycle detection.

8.  Afford rhythm command request of parseable string. This will make ...
        red_segment.set_rhythm("c'32 [ c'16 c'16. ]", contexts=['Voice 1'])
        voice_1_rhythm_command = red_segment.request_rhythm_command('Voice 1')
        red_segment.set_rhythm(voice_1_rhythm_command, contexts=['Voice 2'])
    ... interpret correctly.
    Then make X5 work with rhythm command request instead of rhythm request.

9.  Set all rotation to fracture_spanners=False by default in interpreter.

10. Reimplement rhythm rotation to pay attention to the differences beteween
    spanners that cover components and spanners that dominate components.
    Fill in missing spannertools docstrings before doing this.
