1. Setting.persistent and Setting.truncate from mandatory arguments to keyword arguments
   for reasons of setting repr readability during debugging. Save with ResolvedSetting.

2. Rename TemporalScope to Timespan. This gives setting.target.timespan for access.

3. Possibly rename TemporalCursor to ObjectRelativeTimepoint?

4. Change 'attribute_name' to 'attribute' everywhere because there is not Attribute object.

5. Write by-hand Selection initialization tests.

6. Make Setting inherit from Directive. Or vice versa. Or make both inherit from an ABC.

7. Rename Directive to something like BundledSetting.

8. Implement RetrievalRequest as base class for different retrieval requests classes.

9. Implement selection-creation courtesy methods.

10. Implement timespan-creation courtesy methods.
    First one: self.segment_name_to_timespan(segment_name).

11. Rename VectorConstant to OrdinalConstant. Merge to main line.

12. Change OrdinalConstant storage format to simply repr.
