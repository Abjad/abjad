1.  Make split() work with durated complex beam spanners.

2.  Integrate reverse=None keyword into all segment set methods,
    if integration into SegmentSpecification.set_time_signatures() works out.

3.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

4.  Make divisions (ie, nonreduced fractions) splitable.
    This works:

    n = [mathtools.NonreducedFraction(x) for x in (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10)]
    sequencetools.split_sequence_by_weights(n, [Fraction(3, 2)], cyclic=False, overhang=False)

    But this doesn't:

    n = [divisiontools.Division(x) for x in (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10)]
    sequencetools.split_sequence_by_weights(n, [Fraction(3, 2)], cyclic=False, overhang=False)
