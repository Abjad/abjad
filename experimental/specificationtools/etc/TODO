1.  Kill segment_division_lists.

2.  Reimplement all get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset() pairs
    in terms of a single get_score_offsets() method.

3.  Integrate timespan inequality filtering into all inequality selector classes.

3.  Implement time signature material requests.

4.  Implement from-future time signature material requests.

5.  Implement default time signature value to avoid exception
    when time signatures have not yet been specified.

6.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

7.  Make split() work with durated complex beam spanners.
