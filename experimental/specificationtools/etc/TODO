1.  Reimplement all selector get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset()
    methods to work independently of get_segment_start_offset() and get_segment_stop_offset().
    Then remove all get_segment_start_offset() and get_segment_stop_offset() methods.

2.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

3.  Make split() work with durated complex beam spanners.
