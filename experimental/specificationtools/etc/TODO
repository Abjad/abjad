1.  Reimplement all selector get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset()
    methods to work independently of get_segment_start_offset() and get_segment_stop_offset().
    Then remove all get_segment_start_offset() and get_segment_stop_offset() methods.

2.  Implement time signature material requests.

3.  Implement from-future time signature material requests.

4.  Implement default time signature value to avoid exception
    when time signatures have not yet been specified.

5.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

6.  Make split() work with durated complex beam spanners.
