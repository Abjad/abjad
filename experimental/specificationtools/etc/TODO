1.  Leave OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.start_offset and OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.stop_offset alone.
    Implement something like OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.forced_start_offset for inequality
    selection.

2.  Integrate reverse=None keyword into all segment set methods,
    if integration into SegmentSpecification.set_time_signatures() works out.

3.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

4.  Make divisions (ie, nonreduced fractions) partitionable.
