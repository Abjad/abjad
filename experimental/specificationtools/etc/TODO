1.  Reimplement schematic example X3 using division material requests instead
    of rhythm material requests.

2.  Reimplement all get_score_start_offset() and get_score_stop_offset() pairs
    in terms of a single get_score_offsets() method.

3.  Integrate timespan inequality filtering into all inequality selector classes.

4.  Author tests to make sure that persistent overlapping division selectors 
    can be overwritten in a subsequent segment.

5.  Notice that the SegmentSpecification.set_divisions() 'truncate' keyword means two things.
    It means truncate last division in section. It also means restart divisions at
    beginning of following section. Implement a SegmentSpecification.set_divisions()
    boolean 'restart' keyword to separate these functions. When restart=True
    then truncate will always effectively be interpreted as true.

6.  Change all occurrences of 'duration tokens' (in rhythmmakertools) to 'time tokens' or 'divisions'.

7.  Extend OffsetPositionedRhythmExpression.rotate() with a new 'level=-1' keyword.
    The keyword will specify the score-tree level at which rotation should happen.

8.  Migrate SymbolicOffset, SymbolicTimespan, SingleSourceSymbolicTimespan and
    MixedSourceSymbolicTimespan to a new symbolictimetools package in the experimental branch
    in preparation for timetools merge to mainline.

9.  Rename 'timepoint' to 'offset' everywhere in preparation for timetools merge to mainline.

10. Rename timetools to timerelationtools in preparation for merge to mainline.

11. Rename ScoreSpecification.make_segment() to ScoreSpecification.append_segment().

12. Add tied_notes=True and tied_rests=False keywords to all talea-based rhythm makers.

13. Implement SegmentSpecification.select_multiple_divisions() to return multiple
    selectors at once. This will change ...
        first_division = red_segment.select_division(0)
        second_division = red_segment.select_division(1)
        third_division = red_segment.select_division(2)
    ... into this ...
        first_division, second_division, third_division = red_segment.select_all_divisions()
    ... instead.

14. Implement very basic cycle detection.
