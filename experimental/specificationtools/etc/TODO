1. Remove singular selector classes and use plural selector classes instead.

2. Remove context from all selectors.
   This will mean getting rid of all multiple-context selector classes.
   This will also mean removing the SingleContext designation
   from the remaining selectors.
   This will also mean modeling context explicitly in SingleContextSetting
   and MultipleContextSetting.

3. Part of 2 will mean a TimespanSelector that is free of context. Which is good.

4. Make divisions (ie, nonreduced fractions) partitionable.
