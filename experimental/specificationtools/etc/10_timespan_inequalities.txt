TIMESPAN INEQUALITIES.


Timespans s, t define timepoints s.start, s.stop, t.start and s.stop.

Timerelations between s.start and t.start:
    s.start < t.start       "s starts before t starts"
    s.start == t.start      "s starts when t starts"
    t.start < s.start       "s starts after t starts"

Timerelations between s.start and t.stop:
    s.start < t.stop        "s starts before t stops"
    s.start == t.stop       "starts when t stops"
    t.stop < s.start        "s starts after t stops"

Timerelations between s.stop and t.start:
    s.stop < t.start        "s stops before t starts"
    s.stop == t.start       "s stops when t starts"
    t.start < s.stop        "s stops after t starts"

Timerelations between s.stop and t.stop:
    s.stop < t.stop         "s stops before t stops"
    s.stop == t.stop        "s stops when t stops"
    t.stop < s.stop         "s stops after t stops"

Which combinations of inequality make sense?

All 12 simple inequalities make sense.

From A we choose "s.start < t.start".
From B no others are possible.
From C the first two are impossible and the third is redundant.
From D all three are possible:
    s.start < t.start AND s.stop < t.stop
    s.start < t.start AND s.stop == t.stop
    s.start < t.start AND t.stop < s.stop

From A we choose "s.start == t.start".
From B two are impossible and one is redundant.
From C one is impossible and two are redundant.
From D all three are possible:
    s.start == t.start AND s.stop < t.stop
    s.start == t.start AND s.stop == t.stop
    s.start == t.start AND t.stop < s.stop 

Many others ...

There must be a better way to do this ...
