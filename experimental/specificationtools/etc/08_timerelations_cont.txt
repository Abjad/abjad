TIMERELATIONS (cont).


(4) BETWEEN TWO TIMESPANS. There appear to be 13 ways to pick out
sets of positively durated score objects with respect to an arbitrary
positively durated reference timespan. These are:

    1   "measures that stop before segment starts"
        (all m such that m.start < m.stop < s.start < s.stop)

    2   "measures that stop when segment starts"
        (all m such that m.start < m.stop == s.start < s.stop)

    3   "measures that overlap the start of segment but stop before segment stops"
        (all m such that m.start < s.start < m.stop < s.stop)

    4   "measures that stop with segment but overlap the start of segment"
        (all m such that m.start < s.start < m.stop == s.stop)
    
    5   "measures that overlap both the start and stop of segment"
        (all m such that m.start < s.start < s.stop < m.stop)

    6   "measures that start with segment but stop before segment"
        (all m such that s.start == m.start < m.stop < s.stop)

    7   "measures that start and stop with segment"
        (all m such that s.start == m.start < m.stop == s.stop)

    8   "measures that start with segment but overlap the stop of segment"
        (all m such that s.start == m.start < s.stop < m.stop)

    9   "measures that start after segment starts and stop before segment stops"
        (all m such that s.start < m.start < m.stop < s.stop)

   10   "measures that start after segment starts but stop when segment stops"
        (all m such that s.start < m.start < m.stop == s.stop)

   11   "measures that start after segment starts and overlap segment stop"
        (all m such that s.start < m.start < s.stop < m.stop)

   12   "measures that start when segment stops"
        (all m such that s.start < s.stop == m.start < m.stop)

   13   "measures that start after segment stops"
        (all m such that s.start < s.stop < m.start < m.stop) 


Extensions. Set-theoretic operations are possible on all of the criteria identified.
It looks like logical OR will be enough. For example, the set of all measures
that share no timepoints with the reference segment may be had in the union of the sets
picked out in cases #1 and #13. This is equal to the set of all measures m such that
m.start < m.stop < s.start < s.stop OR s.start < s.stop < m.start < m.stop.
