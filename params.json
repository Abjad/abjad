{"name":"Abjad","tagline":"Abjad is a Python API for Formalized Score Control","body":"abjad\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAbjad helps composers build up complex pieces of music notation in an iterative\r\nand incremental way.\r\n\r\nUse Abjad to create a symbolic representation of all the notes, rests, staves,\r\ntuplets, beams and slurs in any score.\r\n\r\nBecause Abjad extends the Python programming language, you can use Abjad to\r\nmake systematic changes to your music as you work. And because Abjad wraps the\r\npowerful LilyPond music notation package, you can use Abjad to control the\r\ntypographic details of the symbols on the page.\r\n\r\nYou can find Abjad's documentation at http://projectabjad.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis install file refers to Abjad 2.14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbjad depends on Python\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nYou must have Python 2.7.5 installed to run Abjad.\r\n\r\nYou must also have the following Python packages installed:\r\n\r\n    * configobj\r\n    * ply\r\n    * pytest\r\n    * Sphinx\r\n\r\nType the following to check the version of Python installed on your computer:\r\n\r\n    python --version\r\n\r\nYou can download different versions of Python at http://www.python.org.\r\n\r\nNote that Abjad does not yet support the Python 3.x series of releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbjad depends on LilyPond\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nYou must have LilyPond 2.17 or greater installed to run Abjad.\r\n\r\nDownload LilyPond at http://www.lilypond.org.\r\n\r\nType the following to see if LilyPond is callable from your commandline:\r\n\r\n    lilypond --version\r\n\r\nIf LilyPond is not callable from your commandline you should add the location\r\nof the LilyPond executable to your ``PATH`` environment variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nOnline documentation for the most recent release of Abjad is available at\r\nhttp://projectabjad.org.\r\n\r\nPDFs are available in Abjad's ``abjad/docs/pdf/`` directory after you install\r\nthe package.\r\n\r\nMost users will find the online or PDF version of the docs sufficient. If you\r\nwork with Abjad lot and decide to add code to Abjad that you want to contribute\r\nback to the project, it will probably make sense to build a local copy of the\r\ndocs for yourself as you work. To build Abjad's docs locally you'll need to\r\ninstall Graphviz. See http://graphviz.org for instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling the current packaged version of Abjad with pip\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to install Python packages on your computer. One of\r\nthe most direct ways is with ``pip``.\r\n\r\nType the following to find out if ``pip`` is installed on your computer:\r\n\r\n    pip --version\r\n\r\nIf you do not have ``pip`` installed then we strongly recommend that you use\r\nPython's ``easy_install`` to install ``pip`` first:\r\n\r\n    sudo easy_install pip\r\n\r\nThen type the following to install the current packaged version of Abjad:\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install abjad --upgrade\r\n\r\nPython will install Abjad in the site packages directory on your computer.\r\n\r\nYou'll then be ready to start using Abjad.\r\n\r\n\r\nManually installing Abjad from the Python Package Index\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat if you do not have ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` installed on your computer?\r\nThen you should follow these steps to install the current packaged version of\r\nAbjad from the Python Package Index:\r\n\r\n1.  Download the current release of Abjad from \r\n    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Abjad.\r\n\r\n2.  Unarchive the downloaded file. Under MacOS and Windows you can \r\n    double click the archived file.\r\n\r\n    Under Linux execute the following command with ``x.y`` replaced by \r\n    the current release of Abjad:\r\n    \r\n        tar xzvf Abjad-x.y.tar.gz\r\n    \r\n3.  Change into the directory created in step 2:\r\n\r\n        cd Abjad-x.y\r\n\r\n4.  Then run the following under MacOS or Linux:\r\n\r\n        sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\n5.  Or run this command under Windows after starting up a command shell \r\n    with administrator privileges:\r\n\r\n        setup.py install\r\n\r\nPython will install Abjad in the site packages directory on your computer.\r\n\r\nYou'll then be ready to start using Abjad.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguring Abjad\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAbjad creates a ``~/.abjad`` directory the first time it runs.  In ``~/.abjad``\r\nyou will find a the file ``abjad.cfg``.  This is the Abjad configuration file.\r\n\r\nYou can use the Abjad configuration file to tell Abjad about your preferred PDF\r\nfile viewer, MIDI player, your preferred LilyPond language and so on.\r\n\r\nYour configuration filewill look something like this the first time you open\r\nit:\r\n\r\n    # Abjad configuration file created by Abjad on 31 January 2014 00:08:17.\r\n    # File is interpreted by ConfigObj and should follow ini syntax.\r\n\r\n    # Set to the directory where all Abjad-generated files\r\n    # (such as PDFs and LilyPond files) should be saved.\r\n    # Defaults to $HOME.abjad/output/\r\n    abjad_output = /Users/username/.abjad/output\r\n\r\n    # Default accidental spelling (mixed|sharps|flats).\r\n    accidental_spelling = mixed\r\n\r\n    # Comma-separated list of LilyPond files that \r\n    # Abjad will \"\\include\" in all generated *.ly files\r\n    lilypond_includes = ,\r\n\r\n    # Language to use in all generated LilyPond files.\r\n    lilypond_language = english\r\n\r\n    # Lilypond executable path. Set to override dynamic lookup.\r\n    lilypond_path = lilypond\r\n\r\n    # MIDI player to open MIDI files.\r\n    # When unset your OS should know how to open MIDI files.\r\n    midi_player = \r\n\r\n    # PDF viewer to open PDF files.\r\n    # When unset your OS should know how to open PDFs.\r\n    pdf_viewer = \r\n\r\n    # Text editor to edit text files.\r\n    # When unset your OS should know how to open text files.\r\n    text_editor = \r\n\r\nIn Linux you might want to set your ``pdf_viewer`` to ``evince`` and your\r\n``midi_player`` to ``tiMIDIty``.\r\n\r\nThe configuration file follows ``ini`` syntax. So make sure to follow ``ini``\r\nsyntax conventions when editing the Abjad configuration file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
