1.  Implement TestManager.compare_lys().

2.  Integrate diff-pdf.

3.  Integrate candidacy protocol.

4.  Clean up InstrumentInventory.
    Clean up PerformerInventory.

5.  Implement 'views - write' (vw).
    Implement 'views - check' (vc).

6.  Implement '__metadata__.py - check' (mdc).

7.  Implement '__metadata__.py - autoedit' (mda).

8.  Take another pass at (ck) and (ck*) messaging.

9.  Audit (**).

10. Audit all star commands.

11. Audit material interface by hand.
    Audit segment interface by hand.

12. Audit all public methods for py.test files.

13. Answer all inline TODOs.

14. Unskip all skipped tests.

15. Streamline all 39 classfiles.

16. Extended ControllerContext with directory=None keyword.
    This will allow ControllerContext to act like TemporaryDirectoryChange.
    This will then remove some TemporaryDirectoryChange in _run() methods.

17. Make (red m tempo da rm 4 done!) work.
    Right now the (done!) raises an exception.

18. Make autoediting persist when editing nested objects.
    Test by autoediting TaleaRhythmMaker.

19. Redisplay parent object when editing (nested) child object.
    Test by autoediting TaleaRhythmMaker.

20. Implement interface commands to autostart autoediting.
    Implement (da!) to autostart (and thereafter autoadvance) the autoediting 
    of definition.py files. Implement (va!) to autostart (and thereafter
    autoadvance) the autoediting of __views__.py files. Implement (mda!)
    for __metadata__.py files. And in general implement a paired (xa!) for
    every (xa) command, while noting that (da) and (va) are the only two
    autoedit commands currently implemented. This will be a complementary type
    of bang suffix.

21. Integrate Session.is_autoterminating.
    The property will cause autoeditor to terminate editing after 
    composer edits last property on object.
    Implement in such a way that autotermination can persist from one
    composite object to the next.

22. Sort the asset sections in (M), (K) etc according to the same order
    as used in (**).

23. Change (EDIT) to (EDIT*) in Autoeditor menu when target has changed
    but has no yet been written to disk.

24. Make (M ren test~talea~rhythm~maker talea rhythm maker) work.
    Right now the interface insists on
    (M ren test~talea~rhythm~maker talea_rhythm_maker) with snake case.
    Will add input flexibility.
