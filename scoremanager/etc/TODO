1.  Implement red_example_score.materials.divisions to import 
    red_example_score.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.

2.  Implement an 'all whatever - edit' command.

3.  Add (lyrm!) for 'lilypond ly - remove from repository'.
    This will work together with (lyrm) for 'lilypond ly - remove'.
    The difference will be that (lyrm!) will (try to) act on the repository 
    where (lyrm) will only ever work on the filesystem.

4.  Write py.test tests for the following properties and methods:
        PackageManager._repository_add_command
        PackageManager._repository_status_command
        PackageManager._get_added_asset_paths()
        PackageManager._get_unadded_asset_paths()
        PackageManager._get_repository_root_directory()
        PackageManager._is_up_to_date()

5.  Add 'output py - check (omc)' command.
    The command will simply call Python on output.py and print
    anything returned by traceback.print_exc(). Should probably
    also return true on success and false on failure so the command
    can be mapped to many material packages at once and so that
    aggregated reporting can be given afterwards.
    It might make sense to have an 'illustration ly - check (lyc)' command.
    And in general verify commands for every system artifact that can
    be interpreted.

6.  Implement a 'views py - rewrite' (vmrw) command.

7.  Implement PackageManager.check_contents().
    With corresponding 'check - contents' (cc) command.
    The method will list the contents of a directory, compare
    to a known list of acceptable files and globs, and display
    any foreign contents.

8.  Do something to put an empty .gitignore file in every directory everywhere.
    Provide a user interface.
    
9.  Eventually implement a Score PackageManager start-up behavior that will
    run and check the filesystem layout of all assets everywhere and
    prompt the composer to fix as required before composition begins.

10: Bug:
    File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/wranglers/Wrangler.py", 
    line 137, in _get_next_asset_path
        return paths[0]
    IndexError: list index out of range

11. Bug:
    File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/core/ScoreManager.py", line 203, in _get_sibling_score_directory_path
        index = paths.index(score_path)
    ValueError: '/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/betoerung/materials/reiterated_forte' is not in list
    Command history: (bet m reit >>).
    Score navigation from within material packge triggers bug.

12. Implement an Autoeditor method to allow an none-allowing attribute to be 
    (re)set to none.
    Example: change ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs):
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... to ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs): BeamSpecifier(beam_each_division=True, beam_divisions_together=False)
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... and then back to ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs):
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... using the editor.

13. Bug:
    (edit talea rhythm-maker > xcd > 2)
    function = lambda x: all(predicates.is_integer(y) for y in x)
    TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
    The getter is checking for (a tuple or list of) integers;
    then the getter receives only a single integer the getter 
    should not explode.

14. Make (rrv) work for Subversion-managed directories.
    Use (bet > rst) and then (bet > rrv) to reproduce the bug.

15. Make sure new-style.ily doesn't alias (new).
    This blocks the creation of new stylesheets.

16. When in (new) score, change 'Enter package name>' to
    'Enter score package name>'.

17. Block (new) score when view is hiding user scores.
    Otherwise the score package gets created but is hidden.

18. Allow more flexible input for score (new).
    Space-delimited, underscore-delimited, hyphen-delimited should
    all be fine. Use stringtools.delimite_words().

19. Implement stringtools.delimit_words(delimitor=' ').
    This will take any of the usual string forms as input (space-,
    hyphen- and underscore-delimited together with upper- and lower-
    camelcase) and (find and) change the delimitor between
    words according to the keyword.

20. Maybe change Wrangler._current_package_manager to
    Wrangler._current_manager?

21. Make (mdmo) work for wranglers.
    There is now a metadata py in which wranglers store
    things like 'current_view'. The (mdmo) command should
    allow the composer to read that metadata py.

22. Make menu title breadcrumbs correctly reflect changes in view
    and changes in view name.

23. Refuse to apply view when invalid regular expression is found.

24. Imlement 'views - autoedit' (vae) command.

25. Compile regular expressions at view entry add time.
    Refuse to write invalid regular expression.

26. Allow arbitrary metadata in view patterns.

27. Change ...
        Score manager - stylesheets (_test) - select view to remove:
    ... to ...
        Score manager - stylesheets - select view to remove:
    ... instead.

28. Change 'default' to '<return>' in test input strings.
    Makes test more readable.

29. Make (rst) work again. Right now runs on archipel and then quits.
    Maybe add private Subversion tests.

30. Allow 5-99 (or any other large number) to work when removing items.
    Example (y > vnew > foo > rm > 5-99).

31. Move score_manager_library/views/*_views__.py files to
    ~/.score_manager/ directory.

32. Change 'vmrm' to 'vmtrash'.
    No reason to remove views pys from repository.

33. Fix menu title that results from the following:
    (red~example~score m tempo~inventory mae 1 d b q).

34. There is no such thing as 'My build file library'.
    Remove 'My build file library' from (u > cp > 1).

35. Make bicolumnar layout work for asset screens.
    Right now it just works for the (?) screen.

36. Extend 'all score packages' options in Score PackageManager main menu.
    Change ...
        all score packages - fix (fix)
    ... to ...
        all score packages - fix (fix)
        all score packages - initializers - rewrite (inrw)
        all score packages - initializers - open (ino)
        all score packages - metadata pys - open (mdmo)
        all score packages - metadata pys - rewrite (mdmrw)
        all score packages - score pdfs - open (pdfo)
        all score packages - unadded assets - remove (uarm)
    ... instead.

37. Improve (k > cp) user experience. Change ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... to ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        (Name of maker file to copy: RedExampleScoreTemplate.py)
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... instead.

38. Improve (vls) user experience. Change ...
        2 views found:
        cary & sekka
        examples
    ... to ...
        Views found:
            1. cary & sekka
            2. examples
    ... instead.

39. Make (rrv) work in Git directories.
    Can test with (red~example~score g lyi y).
    This will modify all segment output.pdf files.
    Using (rrv) should then run 'git checkout' on each of the output.pdf files.
    But that does not currently work.

40. Improve (rad) user experience. Change
        > rad

        red_example_score/segments/segment_01 ...
        red_example_score/segments/segment_02 ...
        red_example_score/segments/segment_03 ...
        Press return to continue. 
    ... to ...
        > rad

        Added red_example_score/segments/segment_01 to repository ...
        Added red_example_score/segments/segment_02 to repository ...
        Added red_example_score/segments/segment_03 to repository ...

    ... instead.

41. Glue 'go' menu sections together.

42. Remove methods from Session.
    Session should implement properties only.

43. Wrap view tests with FilesystemState.

44. Add 'all segments - list versions directories'.
    Add 'all materials - list versions directories'.
