1.  Answer all inline TODOs.

2.  Unskip all skipped tests.

3.  Streamline all 39 classfiles.

4.  Clean up InstrumentInventory.
    Clean up PerformerInventory.

5.  Implement 'views - write' (ww).
    Implement 'views - check' (vc).

6.  Implement '__metadata__.py - check' (mdc).

7.  Implement '__metadata__.py - autoedit' (mda).

8.  Take another pass at (ck) and (ck*) messaging.

9.  Audit (**).

10. Audit all star commands.

11. Audit material interface by hand.
    Audit segment interface by hand.

12. Audit all public methods for py.test files.

13. Extended ControllerContext with directory=None keyword.
    This will allow ControllerContext to act like TemporaryDirectoryChange.
    This will then remove some TemporaryDirectoryChange in _run() methods.

14. Make (red m tempo da rm 4 done!) work.
    Right now the (done!) raises an exception.

15. Implement interface commands to autostart autoediting.
    Implement (da!) to autostart (and thereafter autoadvance) the autoediting 
    of definition.py files. Implement (wa!) to autostart (and thereafter
    autoadvance) the autoediting of __views__.py files. Implement (mda!)
    for __metadata__.py files. And in general implement a paired (xa!) for
    every (xa) command, while noting that (da) and (wa) are the only two
    autoedit commands currently implemented. This will be a complementary type
    of bang suffix.

16. Sort the asset sections in (M), (K) etc according to the same order
    as used in (**).

17. Change (EDIT) to (EDIT*) in Autoeditor menu when target has changed
    but has no yet been written to disk.

18. Make (M ren test~talea~rhythm~maker talea rhythm maker) work.
    Right now the interface insists on
    (M ren test~talea~rhythm~maker talea_rhythm_maker) with snake case.
    Will add input flexibility.

19. Write in-library and in-score material breadcrumb tests.

20. Make autoadvance halt and insist on reentry of value entered incorrectly
    by composer.

21. Write autoadvance tests that capture some of the good autoadvance
    behaviors implemented so far.

22. Change behavior of lone (/) during autoadvance.
    Right now (/) does two things: stops autoadvance and sets current property
    to none. (/) should instead stop autoadvance put leave current property
    unchanged.

23. Make (b) work during autoadvance.
    The correct behavior should be to abandon and preserve value of current
    property and then to retreat back to previous property, all while
    leaving autoadvance turned on.

24. Prevent (/) autoadvance from terminating autoeditor and writing target to
    disk. The write to disk should always come in response to an explicit
    additional command from the composer. The exception should be the more
    powerful (@) command which can take the composer through all properties
    of an object and then save the target to disk after all properties have
    been entered.

25. Implement something to make sure _command_to_method contains
    neither duplicate commands nor duplicate methods.

26. Change IOManager._make_tab() to just Configuration.tab as a property.

27. Add two blank lines between output chunks in iterative commands.

28. Add (*) suffix to changed assets in asset menu.
    Something like ...
        1: instrumentation (*)
        2: magic numbers
        3: pitch range inventory (*)
        4: tempo inventory (*)
        5: time signatures
    ... will make clear that three packages have changed.

29. Fix zagged pitch-class illustration to remove LilyPond warnings like ...
        illustration.ly:89:75: warning: conflicting note group events
    ... and related.
    Make a test zagged pitch class material package and illustrate to test.

30. Remove blank line at top of first column in two-column layout of (S ??).
    Also at the top of the first column of (M ??) and (D ??) and (U ??).
    But not (G ??).

31. Make (red m magic 1) and (red m magic 3) work.
    Right now (red m magic 2) works. But 1 and 3 are aliased by material
    summary menu section.
    AssertionError: 
    (<MenuSection 'material summary' (33)>, 'explicit', <MenuEntry: '3'>)

32. Integrate artifact candidacy protocol.
    Remaining commands to integrate:
    BuildFileManager: (mi), (dc), (mc)
