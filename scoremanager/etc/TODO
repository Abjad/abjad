1.  Sweep inline scoremanager TODO items.

2.  Edit instrument transposition.

3.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults.
    Implement default value on user input getter.

4.  Fix IOManager.handle_user_input() default handling.

5.  Find a way dynamically to present default notice with default menu entries.

6.  Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

7.  Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

8.  Implement red_example_score.materials.divisions to import 
    red_example_score.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.

9.  Implement MaterialPackageWrangler method to a material package 
    from one location to another.

10. Refactor scoremanager.editors to contain as few classes as possible.

11. Move score/instrumentation.py module to score/materials packages.
    Maybe easiest to do this by creating an
    InstrumentationSpecifierMaterialManager.

12. Make material package illustration work again.
    (score > materials > tempo inventory > pdfm) is the command sequence.

13. These four classes can all be collapsed into one:
        wizards.HandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.ArticulationHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.DynamicHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.RhythmMakerCreationWizard

14. Find a way to get rid of the ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        segment = Segment()
        lilypond_file = segment()
        current_directory_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        systemtools.log_render_lilypond_input(
            lilypond_file,
            output_directory_path=current_directory_path,
            output_file_name_root='output',
            )

    ... at the bottom of each segment definition file.
    There should be a way to call a prebuilt external script
    that does exactly the same thing.

15. Remove MarkupInventoryMaterialManager.illustration_builder().
    Use MarkupInventory.__ilustrate__() instead.

16. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't change FrenchHorn to merely
    Instrument. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't reset
    sounding_pitch_of_written_middle_c to C4.

17. Note that ArticulationHandlerMaterialManager implementation is limited
    to just a handful of class variables. See if the class can be eliminated
    by moving the variables to ArticulationHandler and by teaching
    MaterialManager how to inspect ArticulationHandler class variables. The
    will then be true for DynamicHandlerMaterialManager and a couple of other
    material manager classes.

18. Implement 'segments - tour next' and 'segment - tour previous' commands.
    Maybe generalied 'material - tour' and 'segments - tour' to
    just 'asset - tour'.

19. Implement an 'all whatever - edit' command.

20. Write view tests. Start with segment wrangler.

21. Remove user/score_manager_library/material_package_managers/ in 
    favor of user/score_manager_library/material_managers/

22. Change user/score_manager_library/material_packages/
    to user/score_manager_library/materials/.

23. Search for
        pending_user_input='...'
    ... and replace with ...
        input_ = '...'
        pending_user_input=input_
    ... instead.

24. Remove 'whatever - make' commands. Reimplement as 'source - interpret'.

25. Add command to type arbitrary shell command to current working directory.
    Maybe 'directory - run (run)' of follow Vim with !ls, !pwd and so on.

26. Add confirmation message to (radd).

27. Remove boilerplate commands. Replace with shutil calls in tests.

28. Change 'illustration_builder_module' to 'illustrate_module'.

29. Search for 'whatever_section = menu.make_*_section()' and
    change to 'section = menu.make_*_section()' everywhere.

30. Write test for making new score.
    Score will be made in user score directory.

31. Extend Manager._remove() to use 'trash' if command is found.

32. Implement NaiveCache decorator in systemtools.
    Apply to ScorePackageManager._maker_module_wrangler,
    ScorePackageManager._material_manager_wrangler, etc.
    Maybe the 'lru' decorator works for this already.

33. Make ScorePackageManager create missing top-level directories
    during initialization. Run tests before and after change to check
    for any noticeable slowdown.

34. Make (ls) work in stylesheets menu. So (score > y > ls).

35. Fix Wrangler._read_view_inventory_from_disk() line 305:
        assert len(result) == 1
    TypeError: boject of type 'NoneType' has no len()
    Use (tra > g) to induce bug.

36. Make is_test=False a ScoreManager initializer keyword.
    Hoist up from ScoreManager._run().
