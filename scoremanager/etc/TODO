1.  Implement an 'all whatever - edit' command.

2.  Make sure new-style.ily doesn't alias (new).
    This blocks the creation of new stylesheets.

3.  When in (new) score, change 'Enter package name>' to
    'Enter score package name>'.

4.  Block (new) score when view is hiding user scores.
    Otherwise the score package gets created but is hidden.

5.  Allow more flexible input for score (new).
    Space-delimited, underscore-delimited, hyphen-delimited should
    all be fine. Use stringtools.delimite_words().

6.  Implement stringtools.delimit_words(delimitor=' ').
    This will take any of the usual string forms as input (space-,
    hyphen- and underscore-delimited together with upper- and lower-
    camelcase) and (find and) change the delimitor between
    words according to the keyword.

7.  Make (mdo) work for wranglers.
    There is now a metadata py in which wranglers store
    things like 'current_view'. The (mdo) command should
    allow the composer to read that metadata py.

8.  Make menu title breadcrumbs correctly reflect changes in view
    and changes in view name.

9. Refuse to apply view when invalid regular expression is found.

10. Implement 'views - autoedit' (vae) command.

11. Compile regular expressions at view entry add time.
    Refuse to write invalid regular expression.

12. Change ...
        Abjad IDE - stylesheets (_test) - select view(s) to remove:
    ... to ...
        Abjad IDE - stylesheets - select view(s) to remove:
    ... instead.

13. Allow 5-99 (or any other large number) to work when removing items.
    Example (y > vnew > foo > rm > 5-99).

14. Fix menu title that results from the following:
    (red~example~score m tempo~inventory ae 1 d b q).

15. There is no such thing as 'My build files'.
    Remove 'My build files' from (u > cp > 1).

16. Improve (k > cp) user experience. Change ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... to ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        (Name of maker file to copy: RedExampleScoreTemplate.py)
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... instead.

16. Add 'all segments - list versions directories'.
    Add 'all materials - list versions directories'.

18. Open audio files with audio player. Use (d) for examples to test.

19. Wrap metadata tests with FilesystemState context.

20. Move SargassoMeasureMaker to the makers directory on an example score.
    Remove scoremanager/makers directory.

21. Remove scoremanager/wizards directory.
    Migrate InstrumentCreationWizard to some class in instrumenttools.
    Migrate PerformerCreationWizard to some class in instrumenttools.
    
22. Collapse all Abjad IDE classes to a single package.

23. Improve (rup) messaging.
