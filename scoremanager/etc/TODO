1.  Implement an 'all whatever - edit' command.

2.  Implement PackageManager.check_contents().
    With corresponding 'check - contents' (cc) command.
    The method will list the contents of a directory, compare
    to a known list of acceptable files and globs, and display
    any foreign contents.

3.  Eventually implement a Score PackageManager start-up behavior that will
    run and check the filesystem layout of all assets everywhere and
    prompt the composer to fix as required before composition begins.

4.  Bug:
    (edit talea rhythm-maker > xcd > 2)
    function = lambda x: all(predicates.is_integer(y) for y in x)
    TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
    The getter is checking for (a tuple or list of) integers;
    then the getter receives only a single integer the getter 
    should not explode.

5.  Make (rrv) work for Subversion-managed directories.
    Use (bet > rst) and then (bet > rrv) to reproduce the bug.
    Also make (rrv) work for Git-managed directories;
    maybe 'git checkout ...' should be the underlying implementation.

6.  Make sure new-style.ily doesn't alias (new).
    This blocks the creation of new stylesheets.

7.  When in (new) score, change 'Enter package name>' to
    'Enter score package name>'.

8.  Block (new) score when view is hiding user scores.
    Otherwise the score package gets created but is hidden.

9.  Allow more flexible input for score (new).
    Space-delimited, underscore-delimited, hyphen-delimited should
    all be fine. Use stringtools.delimite_words().

10. Implement stringtools.delimit_words(delimitor=' ').
    This will take any of the usual string forms as input (space-,
    hyphen- and underscore-delimited together with upper- and lower-
    camelcase) and (find and) change the delimitor between
    words according to the keyword.

11. Make (mdo) work for wranglers.
    There is now a metadata py in which wranglers store
    things like 'current_view'. The (mdo) command should
    allow the composer to read that metadata py.

12. Make menu title breadcrumbs correctly reflect changes in view
    and changes in view name.

13. Refuse to apply view when invalid regular expression is found.

14. Implement 'views - autoedit' (vae) command.

15. Compile regular expressions at view entry add time.
    Refuse to write invalid regular expression.

16. Allow arbitrary metadata in view patterns.

17. Change ...
        Score Manager - stylesheets (_test) - select view(s) to remove:
    ... to ...
        Score Manager - stylesheets - select view(s) to remove:
    ... instead.

18. Allow 5-99 (or any other large number) to work when removing items.
    Example (y > vnew > foo > rm > 5-99).

19. Fix menu title that results from the following:
    (red~example~score m tempo~inventory ae 1 d b q).

20. There is no such thing as 'My build files'.
    Remove 'My build files' from (u > cp > 1).

21. Improve (k > cp) user experience. Change ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... to ...
        Enter maker file to copy> 1
        (Name of maker file to copy: RedExampleScoreTemplate.py)
        New maker file name> RedExampleScoreRhythmMaker.py
    ... instead.

22. Make (rrv) work in Git directories.
    Can test with (red~example~score g oli y).
    This will modify all segment output.pdf files.
    Using (rrv) should then run 'git checkout' on each of the output.pdf files.
    But that does not currently work.

23. Add 'all segments - list versions directories'.
    Add 'all materials - list versions directories'.

24. Open audio files with audio player. Use (d) for examples to test.

25. Wrap metadata tests with FilesystemState context.
