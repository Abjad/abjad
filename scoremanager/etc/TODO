1.  Answer all inline TODOs.

2.  Unskip all skipped tests.

3.  Streamline all 40 classfiles.

4.  Implement 'views - write' (ww).
    Implement 'views - check' (wc).

5.  Implement '__metadata__.py - check' (mdc).

6.  Implement '__metadata__.py - autoedit' (mda).

7.  Take another pass at (ck) and (ck*) messaging.

8.  Audit (hh).

9.  Audit all star commands.

10. Audit material interface by hand.
    Audit segment interface by hand.

11. Audit all public methods for py.test files.

12. Extended ControllerContext with directory=None keyword.
    This will allow ControllerContext to act like TemporaryDirectoryChange.
    This will then remove some TemporaryDirectoryChange in _run() methods.

13. Implement interface commands to autostart autoediting.
    Implement (da!) to autostart (and thereafter autoadvance) the autoediting 
    of definition.py files. Implement (wa!) to autostart (and thereafter
    autoadvance) the autoediting of __views__.py files. Implement (mda!)
    for __metadata__.py files. And in general implement a paired (xa!) for
    every (xa) command, while noting that (da) and (wa) are the only two
    autoedit commands currently implemented. This will be a complementary type
    of bang suffix.

14. Sort the asset sections in (mm), (kk) etc according to the same order
    as used in (hh).

15. Write in-library and in-score material breadcrumb tests.

16. Make autoadvance halt and insist on reentry of value entered incorrectly
    by composer.

17. Write autoadvance tests that capture some of the good autoadvance
    behaviors implemented so far.

18. Change behavior of lone (/) during autoadvance.
    Right now (/) does two things: stops autoadvance and sets current property
    to none. (/) should instead stop autoadvance put leave current property
    unchanged.

19. Make (b) work during autoadvance.
    The correct behavior should be to abandon and preserve value of current
    property and then to retreat back to previous property, all while
    leaving autoadvance turned on.

20. Prevent (/) autoadvance from terminating autoeditor and writing target to
    disk. The write to disk should always come in response to an explicit
    additional command from the composer. The exception should be the more
    powerful (@) command which can take the composer through all properties
    of an object and then save the target to disk after all properties have
    been entered.

21. Implement something to make sure _command_to_method contains
    neither duplicate commands nor duplicate methods.

22. Add one blank line between output chunks in iterative commands.

23. Add (*) suffix to changed assets in asset menu.
    Something like ...
        1: magic numbers
        2: performer inventory (*)
        3: pitch range inventory (*)
        4: tempo inventory (*)
        5: time signatures
    ... will make clear that three packages have changed.

24. Fix zagged pitch-class illustration to remove LilyPond warnings like ...
        illustration.ly:89:75: warning: conflicting note group events
    ... and related.
    Make a test zagged pitch class material package and illustrate to test.

25. Implement some sort of autoeditor postfix to allow in-place 'editing'
    of an existing value. Test with (mm > example~talea > da > t-)
    to allow the talea to be copied into the getter as a type of
    prepopulation.

26. Make (dp) work with files to circumvent the reimport trap.

27. Implement something to allow the editing of text files in any
    score's etc/ directory.

28. Make (b) work correctly while in score setup menu.

29. Implement three-column (??) layout.

30. Add something at menu-build time to ensure commands contain no capital
    letters.

31. Make (score > g > ren > a) work. Right now it raises an exception
    when there is a segment named simply 'a'.

32. Make <return> work again for default selection in instrument selection.
    (score > m > performer inventory > oboist > <return>) should select
    oboe as the default instrument. Right now it does nothing.

33. Fix layout of two-column 'select instruments' screen.
    Current view looks like this:

      Score (2014) - materials directory - performer inventory (EDIT)
      
            Select instruments        24: flute              
                                      25: glockenspiel       
         1: accordion                 26: guitar             
         2: alto                      27: harp               
         3: alto flute                28: harpsichord        
         4: alto saxophone            29: horn               
         5: alto trombone             30: marimba            
         6: baritone                  31: mezzo-soprano      
         7: baritone saxophone        32: oboe               
         8: bass                      33: piano              
         9: bass clarinet             34: piccolo            
        10: bass flute                35: sopranino saxophone
        11: bass saxophone            36: soprano            
        12: bass trombone             37: soprano saxophone  
        13: bassoon                   38: tenor              
        14: cello                     39: tenor saxophone    
        15: clarinet in A             40: tenor trombone     
        16: clarinet in B-flat        41: trumpet            
        17: clarinet in E-flat        42: tuba               
        18: contrabass                43: untuned percussion 
        19: contrabass clarinet       44: vibraphone         
        20: contrabass flute          45: viola              
        21: contrabass saxophone      46: violin             
        22: contrabassoon             47: xylophone          
        23: English horn                                     
      
            instruments - skip (skip)
      
      > 

    The 'select instrumets' indicator should be followed by a colon.
    And the right column is two lines too high.

34. Implement some sort of suffixed version of (done) like (done!!)
    that will confirm out of all nested autoeditors.
    Test somewhere like ...
        (score > m > perf > da > perc > i > add > unt > crot > done!!)
    ... or equivalent.

35. Add output of Unix 'date' to top of LilyPond log on each run.
    This will allow (ll) to show when LilyPond was last run.

36. Add Unicode directive to top of all new maker files after calling (new).

37. Implement (rci+) to drop the composer into a text editor.
    This will enable commit messages longer than a single line.

38. Implement EtcFileWrangler.

39. Redefine math operations on Division.
    Should return Division objects where appropriate.
    Compare with NonreducedFraction.

40. Group materials by `output_material_class_name`.

41. Add segment 'definition.py - write .ly' (dy) command.
    The command will do the first half of what 
    'definition.py - illustrate' (di) already does: read definition.py
    and write illustration.ly. The use case for the command is minor: 
    to create an illustration.ly (that presumably would be different than
    the existing illustration.ly) and then allow for inspection of the
    illustration.ly file. Composers will use the command only when (di) won't
    do the trick. Why wouldn't (di) do the trick? Because the two
    illustration.ly files might result in the same resulting PDF, in which
    case candidacy rules will prevent any new files from being written.
    On reflection, maybe some type of suffix to (di) might be cleanest.
    Something like (di@) or the like.

42. Change (di!) and other bang-suffixed commands to push errors to
    terminal (even though the bang means that confirmation is suppressed).
    Basically the principle is to never suppress errors.

43. Change segment_x/illustration.ly to segment_x/score_x_(vy).ly.
    Change segment_x/illustration.pdf to segment_x/score_x_(vy).pdf. 
    The 'ry' will stand for 'version y'.
    So ...
        segment_b/red_example_score_B_(v2).ly
        segment_b/red_example_score_B_(v2).pdf
    ... will be the result.

44. Change ...
        > rad!
        Will add ...
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/definition_0010.py
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/illustration_0010.ly
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/illustration_0010.pdf
    ... to ...
        > rad!
        Adding ...
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/definition_0010.py
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/illustration_0010.ly
            /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/krummzeit/segments/segment_b/versions/illustration_0010.pdf
    ... instead.
    Likewise change ...
        > vr!
        Will copy ...
    ... to ...
        > vr!
        Copying ...
    ... instead.

45. Implement '-' to return to last screen. In emulation of shell.

46. Implement (q!) to quit the IDE and then automatically clear terminal.

47. Implement getters.get_signs (for vectors of -1, 0, 1).

48. Allow A, B, C, ... as shortcuts for (g A), (g B), (g C), ....

49. Optimize segment menu:
    OLD:
        Score (2014) - segments directory - B
        
           1: __init__.py
           2: __metadata__.py
           3: definition.py
           4: illustration.ly
           5: illustration.pdf
           6: versions/
        
              definition.py - edit (de)
              definition.py - illustrate (di)
              definition.py - stub (ds)
        
              illustration.ly - edit (ie)
              illustration.ly - interpret (ii)
              illustration.pdf - open (io)
    NEW:
        Score (2014) - segments directory - B
        
           1: __init__.py
           2: __metadata__.py
           3: definition.py
           4: illustration.ly
           5: illustration.pdf
           6: versions/
        
              definition.py - edit (de)
              definition.py - illustrate (di)
              illustration.pdf - open (io)
    Will involve a few extensions to the menuing system.

50. Add a new 'definition.py - copy' (dcp) command.
    This will allow the composer to be in segment A and copy the
    definition.py file from segment B (all in the same score).
    Convenience function.

51. Allow strings of three characters or more (like 'tempo',
    'perf', 'time') to go automatically any matching material package.
    Allow this from anywhere in a score package. So these will effectively
    be aliases for (m tempo), (m perf), (m time) and so on.
    In general the principle is that nouns (like materials and segments)
    should be identifiable without a prefix like (m) or (g) whereas
    verbs like (di) and (io) probably should require a prefix to
    disambiguate the runtime context.

52. Change (di) to (i). Change (oi) to (i).
    Find a way to structure the menuing system so this is clear.

53. Print Abjad and LilyPond timings to terminal if greater than threshold.

54. Allow 'PH' to match on PitchHandler in makers menu.

55. Investigate AppleScript to see if there's a way to find out which
    file Preview has open at any given time. Then extend the IDE
    IOManager.open() method to continually redisplay the same file
    when rerendering it with (di) (instead of reopening multiple
    Preview pointers to the same file).

56. Do something to allow measure numbers to come out correctly between
    segments even when just building a draft (as opposed to the full score).

57. Set build/score.ly template to tab width of 4 spaces instead of 3.

58. Add build command to copy score.pdf to distribution directory.

59. Extend ScoreManager main menu.
    Include 'package - setup' (p) in main menu when score has just
    been created but not yet set up.
    The interface will then nudge the composer to first steps.

60. Make sure all tests pass when custom view is applied to score menu.
    These three tests currently fail:
    FAIL test_ScorePackageWrangler__list_visible_asset_paths_01
    FAIL test_ScorePackageWrangler__make_main_menu_01
    FAIL test_ScorePackageWrangler_make_package_02

61. Change this (da) behavior:
    > da
        Exception raised in /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/huitzil/materials/pitch_segment/definition.py.
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/idetools/IOManager.py", line 487, in execute_file
            result = self.execute_string(file_contents_string, attribute_names)
        File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/idetools/IOManager.py", line 521, in execute_string
            exec(string, local_namespace, local_namespace)
        File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
        NameError: name 'NumberedPitch' is not defined
        No autoedit target found; would you like to create one? 
    What's going on here is that the definition.py module is corrupt.
    IDE should explain this to composer.
    IDE should refuse to overwrite definition.py file.

62. Organize list of autoeditable classes into two or three sections.
    (m > new > da).
    Instruments should be grouped together.
    Maybe everything else can be grouped together.

63. Extend PromptMakerMixin with append_ratios().

64. Fix build depot copy bug.
    (uu cp 60 traiettorie) causes this problem:
        > traiett
        Existing file name> preface.tex
        New file name]> preface.tex
        Already exists: /Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/tack/build/preface.tex
        Press any key to continue. 
    The composer requests "traiettorie" but the build file wrangler finds
    "tack".

65. Add ...
        import makers
        import materials
    ... to score/__init__.py by default.
    Right now the composer must add the two statements by hand.

66. Make sure (k > ren) does not allow renaming to clobber an existing maker
    file.

67. Make the following not raise a TypeError: 
    (da > RegistrationInventory > add > add > foo).
