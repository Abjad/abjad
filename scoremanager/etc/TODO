1.  Sweep inline scoremanager TODO items.

2.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults.
    Implement default value on user input getter.

3.  Fix IOManager.handle_user_input() default handling.

4.  Find a way dynamically to present default notice with default menu entries.

5.  Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

6.  Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

7.  Implement red_example_score.materials.divisions to import 
    red_example_score.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.

8.  Implement MaterialPackageWrangler method to move a material package 
    from one location to another.

9.  Move score/instrumentation.py module to score/materials packages.
    Maybe easiest to do this by creating an
    InstrumentationSpecifierMaterialManager.

10. Implement an 'all whatever - edit' command.

11. Write view tests. Start with segment wrangler.

12. Add (lyrm!) for 'lilypond ly - remove from repository'.
    This will work together with (lyrm) for 'lilypond ly - remove'.
    The difference will be that (lyrm!) will (try to) act on the repository 
    where (lyrm) will only ever work on the filesystem.

13. Write py.test tests for the following properties and methods:
        Manager._repository_add_command
        Manager._repository_status_command
        Manager._get_added_asset_paths()
        Manager._get_unadded_asset_paths()
        Manager._get_repository_root_directory()
        Manager._is_up_to_date()

14. Add 'output module - check (omc)' command.
    The command will simply call Python on output.py and print
    anything returned by traceback.print_exc(). Should probably
    also return true on success and false on failure so the command
    can be mapped to many material packages at once and so that
    aggregated reporting can be given afterwards.
    It might make sense to have an 'illustration ly - check (lyc)' command.
    And in general verify commands for every system artifact that can
    be interpreted.

15. Make 'vmro' provide a message when no __views__ module is found.

16. Implement a 'views module - rewrite' (vmrw) command.

17. Implement DirectoryManager.check_contents().
    With corresponding 'check - contents' (cc) command.
    The method will list the contents of a directory, compare
    to a known list of acceptable files and globs, and display
    any foreign contents.

18. Do something to put an empty .gitignore file in every directory everywhere.
    Provide a user interface.
    
19. Eventually implement a Score Manager start-up behavior that will
    run and check the filesystem layout of all assets everywhere and
    prompt the composer to fix as required before composition begins.

20: Bug:
    File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/wranglers/Wrangler.py", 
    line 137, in _get_next_asset_path
        return paths[0]
    IndexError: list index out of range

21. Bug:
    File "/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/abjad/scoremanager/core/ScoreManager.py", line 212,
        in _get_next_score_directory_path
        index = paths.index(score_path)
    ValueError: '/Users/trevorbaca/Documents/scores/betoerung/materials/reiterated_forte' is not in list
    Command history: (bet m reit >>).
    Score navigation from within material packge triggers bug.

22. Implement an Editor method to allow an none-allowing attribute to be 
    (re)set to none.
    Example: change ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs):
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... to ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs): BeamSpecifier(beam_each_division=True, beam_divisions_together=False)
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... and then back to ...
        1: talea (t): Talea(counts=(1, 2, 3, 4), denominator=16)
        2: split divisions by counts (sdc):
        3: extra counts per division (xcd):
        4: beam specifier (bs):
        5: burnish specifier (rs):
        6: duration spelling specifier (dss):
        7: tie specifier (ts):
    ... using the editor.

23. Bug:
    (edit talea rhythm-maker > xcd > 2)
    function = lambda x: all(predicates.is_integer(y) for y in x)
    TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
    The getter is checking for (a tuple or list of) integers;
    then the getter receives only a single integer the getter 
    should not explode.

24. Make (rrv) work for Subversion-managed directories.
    Use (bet > rst) and then (bet > rrv) to reproduce the bug.

25. Make 'n' user input work in confirmation dialogue.
    Carefully use (m > example pitch range inventory > mdmrm > n)
    to reproduce the bug.

26. Make sure new-style.ily doesn't alias (new).
    This blocks the creation of new stylesheets.

27. When in (new) score, change 'Enter package name>' to
    'Enter score package name>'.

28. Block (new) score when view is hiding user scores.
    This is true when (ssx) is the current view.
    Otherwise the score package gets created but is hidden.

29. Allow more flexible input for score (new).
    Space-delimited, underscore-delimited, hyphen-delimited should
    all be fine. Use stringtools.delimite_words().

30. Implement stringtools.delimit_words(delimitor=' ').
    This will take any of the usual string forms as input (space-,
    hyphen- and underscore-delimited together with upper- and lower-
    camelcase) and (find and) change the delimitor between
    words according to the keyword.

31. Maybe change Wrangler._current_package_manager to
    Wrangler._current_manager?

32. Make (mdmro) work for wranglers.
    There is now a metadata module in which wranglers store
    things like 'current_view'. The (mdmro) command should
    allow the composer to read that metadata module.

33. Make menu title breadcrumbs correctly reflect changes in view
    and changes in view name.

34. Refuse to apply view when invalid regular expression is found.

35. Imlement 'views - autoedit' (vae) command.

36. Change 'material - autoedit' (ma) alias to (mae).

37. Compile regular expressions at view entry add time.
    Refuse to write invalid regular expression.

38. Allow arbitrary metadata in view patterns.

39. Change '... - views - front cover - edit' to
    '... views - front cover view - edit:'.
    Note both 'front cover *view*' and the colon.

40. Change ...
        Untitled (test_score)
    ... to just ...
        test_score
    ... in Score Manager main menu.

41. Change ...
        Score manager - stylesheet library (_test view) - select view to remove:
    ... to ...
        Score manager - stylesheet library - select view to remove:
    ... instead.

42. Change 'default' to '<return>' in test input strings.
    Makes test more readable.
