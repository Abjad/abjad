1.  Sweep inline scoremanager TODO items.

2.  Edit instrument transposition.

3.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults.
    Implement default value on user input getter.

4.  Fix IOManager.handle_user_input() default handling.

5.  Find a way dynamically to present default notice with default menu entries.

6.  Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

7.  Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

8.  Implement red_example_score.materials.divisions to import 
    red_example_score.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.

9.  Implement MaterialPackageWrangler method to a material package 
    from one location to another.

10. Refactor scoremanager.editors to contain as few classes as possible.

11. Move score/instrumentation.py module to score/materials packages.
    Maybe easiest to do this by creating an
    InstrumentationSpecifierMaterialManager.

12. Make material package illustration work again.
    (score > materials > tempo inventory > pdfm) is the command sequence.

13. These four classes can all be collapsed into one:
        wizards.HandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.ArticulationHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.DynamicHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.RhythmMakerCreationWizard

14. Make the (p) and (y) commands work from anywhere within a score.
    Leave the commands lowercase.

14. There also needs to be a single command to just view the global stylesheet
    for the entire score. Something like (Y) or equivalent.

15. Find a way to get rid of the ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        segment = Segment()
        lilypond_file = segment()
        current_directory_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        systemtools.log_render_lilypond_input(
            lilypond_file,
            output_directory_path=current_directory_path,
            output_file_name_root='output',
            )

    ... at the bottom of each segment definition file.
    There should be a way to call a prebuilt external script
    that does exactly the same thing.

16. Remove MarkupInventoryMaterialManager.illustration_builder().
    Use MarkupInventory.__ilustrate__() instead.

17. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't change FrenchHorn to merely
    Instrument. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't reset
    sounding_pitch_of_written_middle_c to C4.

18. Implement something to tour everything that can be rewritten and rewrite.
    Initializers, metadata modules, user input modules, etc. This will allow
    output formatting changes to be applied to all collateral with a single
    command.

19. Note that ArticulationHandlerMaterialManager implementation is limited
    to just a handful of class variables. See if the class can be eliminated
    by moving the variables to ArticulationHandler and by teaching
    MaterialManager how to inspect ArticulationHandler class variables. The
    will then be true for DynamicHandlerMaterialManager and a couple of other
    material manager classes.

20. Change 'output material - interact (omi)' to 
    'output material - edit (ome)'.
