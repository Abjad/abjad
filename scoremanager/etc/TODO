1.  Edit instrument transposition.

2.  Make user input getter defaults work like menu defaults.
    Implement default value on user input getter.

3.  Fix IOManager.handle_user_input() default handling.

4.  Find a way dynamically to present default notice with default menu entries.

5.  Distinguish positional editor parameters from keyword editor parameters.

6.  Audit the UI of the entire materials management system by hand.

7.  Implement red_example_score.materials.divisions to import 
    red_example_score.materials.time_signatures.
    This will implement an intrapackage material import.

8.  Replace all _read_only_attributes.py and _public_attributes.py 
    test files with doctests.

9.  Sweep inline scoremanager TODO items.

10. Author StylesheetWrangler.remove() test.
    Will involve making pending_user_input='... rm ...' work with named 
    arguments instead of just numeric arguments.

11. Make MaterialManager classes stop creating materials in 
    the scoremanager/materials/ directory.
    Those classes should create material packages in the user asset 
    library material packages directory.
    Or in user score packages. But no material packages should ever 
    be created in the scoremanager/materials/ directory.

12. Implement material methods to move material packages 
    from one location to another.

13. Finish the docstrings for all io classes.

14. Refactor scoremanager.editors to contain as few classes as possible.

15. Refactor score manager wizard classes to use instance attributes in place
    of class attributes.

16. Figure out the correct ajv replace regex to change tratiettore/music
    to just traiettorie.

17. Move score/instrumentation.py module to score/materials packages.
    Maybe easiest to do this by creating an
    InstrumentationSpecifierMaterialManager.

18. Make material package illustration work again.
    (score > materials > tempo inventory > pdfm) is the command sequence.

19. These four classes can all be collapsed into one:
        wizards.HandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.ArticulationHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.DynamicHandlerCreationWizard
        wizards.RhythmMakerCreationWizard

20. Make the (u), (k), (m), (g), (p), (t) and (y) commands work from anywhere
    within a score. Leave the commands lowercase.

20. There also needs to be a single command to just view the global stylesheet
    for the entire score. Something like (Y) or equivalent.

21. Find a way to get rid of the ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        segment = Segment()
        lilypond_file = segment()
        current_directory_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        systemtools.log_render_lilypond_input(
            lilypond_file,
            output_directory_path=current_directory_path,
            output_file_name_root='output',
            )

    ... at the bottom of each segment definition file.
    There should be a way to call a prebuilt external script
    that does exactly the same thing.

22. Eliminate unqualified test files like test_ScorePackageManager.py.

23. Remove bug that allows for creation of ...
        metadata = collections.OrderedDict([
            ('', ''),
            ])
    ... without allowing for removal.

24. Remove MarkupInventoryMaterialManager.illustration_builder().
    Use MarkupInventory.__ilustrate__() instead.

25. Write test for (ren) to rename.

26. Write test to make sure that ...
        # -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
        from abjad import *
        _output_material_module_import_statements = []


        some_material = None
    ... shows up as the exact file contents in response to (materials) > (nmh)
    > ... > (mde).

27. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't change FrenchHorn to merely
    Instrument. Make sure that editing instrumentation doesn't reset
    sounding_pitch_of_written_middle_c to C4.

28. Replace hard-coded 'vi -R {}' commands with a portable io manager method.

29. Implement something to tour everything that can be rewritten and rewrite.
    Initializers, metadata modules, user input modules, etc. This will allow
    output formatting changes to be applied to all collateral with a single
    command.

30. Note that ArticulationHandlerMaterialManager implementation is limited
    to just a handful of class variables. See if the class can be eliminated
    by moving the variables to ArticulationHandler and by teaching
    MaterialManager how to inspect ArticulationHandler class variables. The
    will then be true for DynamicHandlerMaterialManager and a couple of other
    material manager classes.
