Python "hello, world!" (in a file)
==================================

This tutorial recaps the Python "hello, world!"
of the previous the tutorial.
The difference is that here you'll save
the code you write to disk.


Writing the file
----------------

Change to whatever directory you'd like and then use your text editor
to create a new file called ``hello_world.py``.

Type the following line of Python code into ``hello_world.py``::

    print 'hello, world!'

Save ``hello_world.py`` when you're done.


Interpreting the file
---------------------

Open the terminal and call Python on ``hello_world.py``::

    $ python hello_world.py
    hello, world!

Python reads ``hello_world.py`` as input and outputs ``hello, world!`` to the terminal.


Repeating the process
---------------------

Working with Python files means doing these things::

    1. write a file
    2. interpret the file
    3. repeat 1 - 2

Experience will make this edit-interpret loop familiar.
And no matter how complicated the projects you develop 
this way of working with Python files will stay the same.
