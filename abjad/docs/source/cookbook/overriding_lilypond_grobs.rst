Overriding LilyPond grobs
=========================

..  abjad::

    import abjad

LilyPond models music notation as a collection of graphic objects or grobs.


Grobs control typography
------------------------

LilyPond grobs control the typographic details of the score:

..  abjad::

    staff = abjad.Staff("c'4 ( d'4 ) e'4 ( f'4 ) g'4 ( a'4 ) g'2")

..  abjad::

    f(staff)

..  abjad::

    show(staff)

In the example above LilyPond creates a grob for every printed glyph.  This
includes the clef and time signature as well as the note-heads, stems and
slurs. If the example included beams, articulations or an explicit key
signature then LilyPond would create grobs for those as well.


Abjad grob-override component plug-ins
--------------------------------------

Abjad lets you work with LilyPond grobs.

All Abjad containers have a grob-override plug-in:

..  abjad::

    staff = abjad.Staff("c'4 d'4 e'4 f'4 g'4 a'4 g'2")
    show(staff)

..  abjad::

    abjad.override(staff).staff_symbol.color = 'blue'

..  abjad::

    show(staff)

All Abjad leaves have a grob-override plug-in, too:

..  abjad::

    leaf = staff[-1]

..  abjad::
    
    override(leaf).note_head.color = 'red'
    override(leaf).stem.color = 'red'

..  abjad::

    show(staff)

And so do Abjad spanners:

..  abjad::

    slur = abjad.Slur()
    attach(slur, staff[:])
    abjad.override(slur).slur.color = 'red'

..  abjad::

    show(staff)


Nested Grob properties can be overriden
---------------------------------------

In the above example, ``staff_symbol``, ``note_head`` and ``stem`` correspond
to the LilyPond grobs ``StaffSymbol``, ``NoteHead`` and ``Stem``, while
``color`` in each case is the color properties of that graphic object.

It is not uncommon in LilyPond scores to see more complex overrides, consisting
of a grob name and a list of two or more property names:

::

    \override StaffGrouper #'staff-staff-spacing #'basic-distance = #7

To achieve the Abjad equivalent, concatenate the property names with
double-underscores:

..  abjad::

    staff = abjad.Staff()
    abjad.override(staff).staff_grouper.staff_staff_spacing__basic_distance = 7
    f(staff)

Abjad will explode the double-underscore delimited Python property into a
LilyPond property list.


Check the LilyPond docs
-----------------------

New grobs are added to LilyPond from time to time.
