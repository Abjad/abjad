Introduction
------------

Quickstart
----------

1. Get Abjad and LilyPond
`````````````````````````

Get Abjad via `pip`_::

    ~$ sudo pip install abjad

Get `LilyPond`_ from http://lilypond.org/development.html.

Consult our installation instructions for detailed help on getting Abjad,
setting it up, and installing any dependencies like `LilyPond`_:

    installation

2. Make notation
````````````````

Start your Python interpreter and import Abjad:

..  abjad::

    import abjad

Then use Abjad to create and show notation:

..  abjad::

    duration = abjad.Duration(1, 4)
    notes = [abjad.Note(pitch, duration) for pitch in range(8)]
    staff = abjad.Staff(notes)
    abjad.show(staff)

Note that you can click on any music notation you find in Abjad's documentation
to see its `LilyPond`_ source code.

You might notice that the music notation throughout Abjad's documentation
doesn't quite look like what `LilyPond`_ produces out-of-the-box.
There are a number of small differences. For example, all of the notes,
chords and rests are spaced proportionally. There are no bar numbers. The
glissandi are a little bit thicker than normal. Tuplet brackets show the
tuplet ratio rather than a single number.

How does this happen? Our notation examples are generated as part of
Abjad's doc-building process via a custom `Sphinx`_ extension housed in
Abjad's :py:mod:`abjadbooktools <abjad.tools.abjadbooktools>` subpackage.
To get the look-and-feel we want for our examples, we include a default
:download:`stylesheet <_stylesheets/default.ily>` in each generated file.

Not all examples are styled the same. When demonstrating `LilyPond`_
overrides or page layout options we may replace Abjad's default
documentation stylesheet with another stylesheet or disable documentation
stylesheets entirely. If, while examining the `LilyPond`_ source files in
Abjad's documentation, you encounter ``\include "..."`` statements in those
files, you can find the corresponding stylesheets in Abjad's documentation
source directory: ``abjad/docs/source/_stylesheets/``.

Now, let's split the notes you just made every 5/16 duration, transpose every
other split group up by a major-seventh, then slur every split group and
finally attach an accent to the first note of each split group:


..  abjad::

    shards = abjad.mutate(staff[:]).split(
        durations=[abjad.Duration(5, 16)],
        cyclic=True,
        tie_split_notes=False,
        )
    for index, shard in enumerate(shards):
        if index % 2:
            abjad.mutate(shard).transpose('M7')
        if 1 < len(shard):
            abjad.attach(abjad.Slur(), shard)
        abjad.attach(abjad.Articulation('accent'), shard[0])

    abjad.show(staff)

Now let's create a second staff, copied from the first, invert all of the new
staff's pitches around middle-G and finally group both staves into a staff
group:

..  abjad::

    copied_staff = abjad.mutate(staff).copy()
    staff_group = abjad.StaffGroup([staff, copied_staff])
    for note in abjad.iterate(copied_staff).leaves(pitched=True):
        note.written_pitch = note.written_pitch.invert(axis='G4')

    abjad.show(staff_group)

Explore Abjad's documentation to find even more ways you can create and
transform notation with `Python`_, `LilyPond`_ and Abjad.

Upcoming Events

`CCRMA Summer Workshop`_ 
````````````````````````

August 07-11, 2017 | Palo Alto, CA

Introduction to the production of professionally engraved musical scores
using the Python programming language and the Abjad API for Formalized
Score Control as part of compositional practice.

The course introduces Abjad's object-oriented approach to music notation
and algorithmic composition through real-world examples and hands-on coding
activities. No previous programming experience is required. Python basics
will be taught from the ground up during the course with musical examples
designed to make sense to composers.

Topics covered include:

-   system installation and configuration,
-   defining your own functions, classes and modules,
-   generating structured tableaux of rhythms, pitch collections and other materials during precomposition,
-   managing polyphony with operations on voices, staves and other musical containers,
-   working with parametric score layout,
-   understanding the document structure of complex scores, and
-   controlling the details of musical typography programmatically.

Taught by Jeff Treviño, Trevor Bača, and Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer.
