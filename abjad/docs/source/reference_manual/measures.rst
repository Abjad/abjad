Measures

Understanding measures in LilyPond
----------------------------------

In LilyPond you specify time signatures by hand and LilyPond creates measures
automatically:

::

    \new Staff {
        \time 3/8
        c'8
        d'8
        e'8
        d'8
        e'8
        f'8
        \time 2/4
        g'4
        e'4
        f'4
        d'4
        c'2
    }

<abjad>[hide=true]
staff = Staff("abj: | 3/8 c'8 d' e' || 3/8 d' e' f' || 2/4 g'4 e'4 || 2/4 f' d' || 2/4 c'2 |")
show(staff)
</abjad>

Here LilyPond creates five measures from two time signatures. This happens
because behind-the-scenes LilyPond time-keeping tells the program when measures
start and stop and how to draw the barlines that come between them.


Understanding measures in Abjad
-------------------------------

Measures are optional in Abjad, too, and you may omit them in favor of time
signatures:

<abjad>
staff = Staff("c'8 d'8 e'8 d'8 e'8 f'8 g'4 e'4 f'4 d'4 c'2")
time_signature_1 = indicatortools.TimeSignature((3, 8))
time_signature_2 = indicatortools.TimeSignature((2, 4))
attach(time_signature_1, staff)
attach(time_signature_2, staff[6])
show(staff)
</abjad>

But you may also include explicit measures in the Abjad scores you build. The
following sections explain how.


Creating measures
-----------------

Create a measure with a time signature and music:

<abjad>
measure = Measure(TimeSignature((3, 8)), "c'8 d'8 e'8")
show(measure)
</abjad>
