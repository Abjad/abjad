Voices
======


Making a voice from a LilyPond input string
-------------------------------------------

You can make a voice from a LilyPond input string:

<abjad>
voice = Voice("c'8 d'8 e'8 f'8 g'8 a'8 b'4 c''1")
show(voice)
</abjad>


Making a voice from a list of other components
----------------------------------------------

You can also make a voice from a list of other components:

<abjad>
tuplet = Tuplet(Multiplier(2, 3), "c'4 d'4 e'4")
components = [tuplet, Note("f'2"), Note("g'1")]
voice = Voice(components)
show(voice)
</abjad>


Understanding the interpreter representation of a voice
-------------------------------------------------------

The interpreter representation of a voice contains three parts:

<abjad>
voice
</abjad>

``Voice`` tells you the voice's class.

``3`` tells you the voice's length (which is the number of
top-level components the voice contains).

Curly braces ``{`` and ``}`` tell you that the music inside the voice is
interpreted sequentially rather than simultaneously.


Formatting voices
-----------------

Use ``format()`` to get the LilyPond format of a voice:

<abjad>
print format(voice, 'lilypond')
</abjad>


Selecting the components in a voice
-----------------------------------

Select the components in a voice like this:

<abjad>
voice[:]
</abjad>


Selecting a voice's leaves
--------------------------

Use ``select_leaves()`` to select the leaves in a voice:

<abjad>
voice.select_leaves()
</abjad>


Getting the length of a voice
-----------------------------

Use ``len()`` to get the length of a voice.

The length of a voice is defined equal to the number of top-level components
the voice contains:

<abjad>
len(voice)
</abjad>


Inspecting voice duration
-------------------------

Use the inspector to get the duration of a voice:

<abjad>
inspect(voice).get_duration()
</abjad>


Appending one component to the end of a voice
---------------------------------------------

Use ``append()`` to append one component to the end of a voice:

<abjad>
voice.append(Note("af'2"))
show(voice)
</abjad>

You can also use a LilyPond input string:

<abjad>
voice.append("bf'2")
show(voice)
</abjad>


Extending a voice with multiple components at once
--------------------------------------------------

Use ``extend()`` to extend a voice with multiple components at once:

<abjad>
notes = [Note("g'4"), Note("f'4")]
voice.extend(notes)
show(voice)
</abjad>

You can also use a LilyPond input string:

<abjad>
voice.extend("e'4 ef'4")
show(voice)
</abjad>


Finding the index of a component in a voice
-------------------------------------------

Use ``index()`` to find the index of any component in a voice:

<abjad>
notes[0]
</abjad>

<abjad>
voice.index(notes[0])
</abjad>


Popping a voice component by index
----------------------------------

Use ``pop()`` to pop the last component of a voice:

<abjad>
voice.pop()
show(voice)
</abjad>


Removing a voice component by reference
---------------------------------------

Use ``remove()`` to remove any component from a voice by reference:

<abjad>
voice.remove(voice[-1])
show(voice)
</abjad>


Naming voices
-------------

You can name Abjad voices:

<abjad>
voice.name = 'Upper Voice'
</abjad>

Voice names appear in LilyPond input but not in notation output:

<abjad>
f(voice)
</abjad>

<abjad>
show(voice)
</abjad>


Changing the context of a voice
-------------------------------

The context of a voice is set to ``'Voice'`` by default:

<abjad>
voice.context_name
</abjad>

But you can change the context of a voice if you want.

Change the context of a voice when you have defined a new LilyPond context
based on a LilyPond voice:

<abjad>
voice.context_name = 'SpeciallyDefinedVoice'
</abjad>

<abjad>
voice.context_name
</abjad>

<abjad>
f(voice)
</abjad>
