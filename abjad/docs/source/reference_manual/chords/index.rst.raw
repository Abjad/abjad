Chords
======

Making chords from a LilyPond input string
------------------------------------------

You can make chords from a LilyPond input string:

<abjad>
chord = Chord("<c' d' bf'>4")
show(chord)
</abjad>


Making chords from numbers
--------------------------

You can also make chords from pitch numbers and duration:

<abjad>
chord = Chord([0, 2, 10], Duration(1, 4))
show(chord)
</abjad>


Getting all the written pitches of a chord at once
--------------------------------------------------

You can get all the written pitches of a chord at one time:

<abjad>
chord.written_pitches
</abjad>

Abjad returns a read-only tuple of named pitches.


Getting the written pitches of a chord one at a time
----------------------------------------------------

You can get the written pitches of a chord one at a time:

<abjad>
chord.written_pitches[0]
</abjad>

Chords index the pitch they contain starting from ``0``, just like tuples and
lists.


Adding one note head to a chord at a time
-----------------------------------------

Use ``append()`` to add one note head to a chord.

You can add a note head to a chord with a pitch number:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads.append(9)
show(chord)
</abjad>

Or you can add a note head to a chord with a pitch name:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads.append("df''")
show(chord)
</abjad>

Chords sort their note heads every time you add a new one.

This means you can add note heads to your chord in any order.


Adding many pitches to a chord at once
--------------------------------------

Use ``extend()`` to add many note heads to a chord.

You can use pitch numbers:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads.extend([3, 4, 14])
show(chord)
</abjad>

Or you can use pitch names:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads.extend(["g''", "af''"])
show(chord)
</abjad>


Deleting pitches from a chord
-----------------------------

Delete note heads from a chord with ``del()``:

<abjad>
del(chord.note_heads[0])
show(chord)
</abjad>

Negative indices work too:

<abjad>
del(chord.note_heads[-1])
show(chord)
</abjad>


Tweaking note heads
-------------------

You can tweak note heads like this:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads[2].tweak.color = 'red'
chord.note_heads[3].tweak.color = 'blue'
chord.note_heads[4].tweak.color = 'green'
show(chord)
</abjad>


Working with empty chords
-------------------------

Abjad allows empty chords:

<abjad>
chord = Chord([], Duration(1, 4))
chord
</abjad>

But if you pass empty chords to ``show()`` LilyPond will complain
because empty chords don't constitute valid LilyPond input.

When you are done working with an empty chord you can add pitches back
into it chord in any of the ways described above:

<abjad>
chord.note_heads.extend(["gf'", "df''", "g''"])
show(chord)
</abjad>
