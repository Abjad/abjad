        Selection(Note("c'8"), Note("c'8"), Note("c'8"), Note("c'8"))

    Make `count` repeated logical ties with tied `duration`:

    ::

        >>> notes = scoretools.make_repeated_notes(2, (5, 16))
        >>> voice = Voice(notes)

            c'4 ~

    Make ad hoc tuplet holding `count` repeated notes with
    non-power-of-two `duration`:

    ::

        >>> scoretools.make_repeated_notes(3, (1, 12))
        Selection(Tuplet(Multiplier(2, 3), "c'8 c'8 c'8"),)

    Set pitch of all notes created to middle C.

    Returns list of zero or more newly constructed notes or list
    of one newly constructed tuplet.
