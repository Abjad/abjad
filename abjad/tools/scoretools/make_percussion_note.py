def make_percussion_note(pitch, total_duration, max_note_duration=(1, 8)):
    r'''Makes short note with `max_note_duration` followed
    by rests together totaling `total_duration`.

    Returns list of newly constructed note followed by zero or
    more newly constructed rests.

    Durations of note and rests returned will sum to `total_duration`.

    Duration of note returned will be no greater than `max_note_duration`.

    Duration of rests returned will sum to note duration taken
    from `total_duration`.

    Useful for percussion music where attack duration is negligible
    and tied notes undesirable.
