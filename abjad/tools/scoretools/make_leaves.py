    ..  container:: example
    
        **Example 1.** Integer and string elements in `pitches` result in 
        notes:

        ::

            >>> pitches = [2, 4, 'F#5', 'G#5']
            >>> duration = Duration(1, 4)
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, duration)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {

                fs''4
                gs''4
            }

    ..  container:: example
    
        **Example 2.** Tuple elements in `pitches` result in chords:

        ::

            >>> pitches = [(0, 2, 4), ('F#5', 'G#5', 'A#5')]
            >>> duration = Duration(1, 2)
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, duration)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                <c' d' e'>2
                <fs'' gs'' as''>2
            }

    ..  container:: example
        
        **Example 3.** None-valued elements in `pitches` result in rests:

        ::

            >>> pitches = 4 * [None]
            >>> durations = [Duration(1, 4)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = scoretools.RhythmicStaff(leaves)

                r4
                r4
            }

    ..  container:: example
        
        **Example 4.** You can mix and match values passed to `pitches`:

        ::

            >>> pitches = [(0, 2, 4), None, 'C#5', 'D#5']
            >>> durations = [Duration(1, 4)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                <c' d' e'>4
                r4
                cs''4
                ds''4
            }

    ..  container:: example
            
        **Example 5.** Read `pitches` cyclically when the length of `pitches`
        is less than the length of `durations`:

        ::

            >>> pitches = ['C5']
            >>> durations = 2 * [Duration(3, 8), Duration(1, 8)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

                c''8
                c''4.
                c''8
            }

    ..  container:: example
            
        **Example 6.** Read `durations` cyclically when the length of 
        `durations` is less than the length of `pitches`:

        ::

            >>> pitches = "c'' d'' e'' f''"
            >>> durations = [Duration(1, 4)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

                e''4
                f''4
            }

    ..  container:: example
            
        **Example 7.** Elements in `durations` with non-power-of-two 
        denominators result in tuplet-nested leaves: 
        
        ::

            >>> pitches = ['D5']
            >>> durations = [Duration(1, 3), Duration(1, 3), Duration(1, 3)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {

                    d''2
                    d''2
                }
            }

    ..  container:: example
            
        **Example 8.** Set `decrease_durations_monotonically` to true to 
        return nonassignable durations tied from greatest to least:

        ::

            >>> pitches = ['D#5']
            >>> durations = [Duration(13, 16)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(pitches, durations)
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> time_signature = TimeSignature((13, 16))
            >>> attach(time_signature, staff)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                \time 13/16
                ds''2. ~
                ds''16
            }

    ..  container:: example
            
        **Example 9.** Set `decrease_durations_monotonically` to false 
        to return nonassignable durations tied from least to greatest:

        ::

            >>> pitches = ['E5']
            >>> durations = [Duration(13, 16)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(
            ...     pitches, 
            ...     durations,
            ...     decrease_durations_monotonically=False,
            ...     )
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> time_signature = TimeSignature((13, 16))
            >>> attach(time_signature, staff)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                \time 13/16
                e''16 ~
                e''2.
            }

    ..  container:: example
        
        **Example 10.** Set `tie_rests` to true to return tied rests for 
        nonassignable durations. Note that LilyPond does not engrave 
        ties between rests:

        ::

            >>> pitches = [None]
            >>> durations = [Duration(5, 8)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(
            ...     pitches, 
            ...     durations, 
            ...     tie_rests=True,
            ...     )
            >>> staff = scoretools.RhythmicStaff(leaves)
            >>> time_signature = TimeSignature((5, 8))
            >>> attach(time_signature, staff)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new RhythmicStaff {
                \time 5/8
                r2 ~
                r8
            }

    ..  container:: example
    
        **Example 11.** Set `forbidden_written_duration` to avoid notes 
        greater than or equal to a certain written duration:

        ::

            >>> pitches = "f' g'"
            >>> durations = [Duration(5, 8)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(
            ...     pitches,
            ...     durations,
            ...     forbidden_written_duration=Duration(1, 2),
            ...     )
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> time_signature = TimeSignature((5, 4))
            >>> attach(time_signature, staff)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                \time 5/4
                f'4 ~
                f'4 ~
                f'8
                g'4 ~
                g'4 ~
                g'8
            }

    ..  container:: example
        
        **Example 12.** You may set `forbidden_written_duration` and
        `decrease_durations_monotonically` together:

        ::

            >>> pitches = "f' g'"
            >>> durations = [Duration(5, 8)]
            >>> leaves = scoretools.make_leaves(
            ...     pitches,
            ...     durations,
            ...     forbidden_written_duration=Duration(1, 2),
            ...     decrease_durations_monotonically=False,
            ...     )
            >>> staff = Staff(leaves)
            >>> time_signature = TimeSignature((5, 4))
            >>> attach(time_signature, staff)
            >>> show(staff) # doctest: +SKIP

        ..  doctest::

            >>> print format(staff)
            \new Staff {
                \time 5/4
                f'8 ~
                f'4 ~
                f'4
                g'8 ~
                g'4 ~
                g'4
            }

    Returns selection of unincorporated leaves.
