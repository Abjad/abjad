    r'''Makes repeated notes with `pitch` and `written_duration` summing to
    `total_duration` under `prolation`.

    ::

        >>> args = [0, Duration(1, 16), Duration(1, 4)]
        >>> notes = scoretools.make_repeated_notes_with_shorter_notes_at_end(*args)

            c'16
            c'16
            c'16
        }

    Fill power-of-two remaining duration with power-of-two notes of lesser written duration:

    ::

        >>> args = [0, Duration(1, 16), Duration(9, 32)]
        >>> notes = scoretools.make_repeated_notes_with_shorter_notes_at_end(*args)

    Fill non-power-of-two remaining duration with ad hoc tuplet:

    ::

        >>> notes = scoretools.make_repeated_notes_with_shorter_notes_at_end(*args)

        \new Voice {
            c'16
            c'16
            c'16
            c'16
            c'16
            c'16
            \tweak #'edge-height #'(0.7 . 0)
            \times 4/5 {
                c'32
            }
        }

    Set `prolation` when making notes in a measure with a non-power-of-two denominator.

    Returns list of components.
