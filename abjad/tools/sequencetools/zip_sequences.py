def zip_sequences(sequences, cyclic=False, truncate=True):
    r'''Zips `sequences`.

    ..  container:: example

        Zips two `sequences` cyclically:

        ::

            >>> sequences = [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b']]
            >>> sequencetools.zip_sequences(sequences, cyclic=True)
            [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'a')]

    ..  container:: example

        Zips three `sequences` cyclically:

        ::

            >>> sequences = [[10, 11, 12], [20, 21], [30, 31, 32, 33]]
            >>> sequencetools.zip_sequences(sequences, cyclic=True)
            [(10, 20, 30), (11, 21, 31), (12, 20, 32), (10, 21, 33)]

    ..  container:: example

        Zips sequences without truncation:

        ::

            >>> sequences = ([1, 2, 3, 4], [11, 12, 13], [21, 22, 23])
            >>> sequencetools.zip_sequences(sequences, truncate=False)
            [(1, 11, 21), (2, 12, 22), (3, 13, 23), (4,)]

    ..  container:: example

        Zips sequences noncyclically and with truncation.
        Equivalent to built-in ``zip()``:

        ::

            >>> sequences = ([1, 2, 3, 4], [11, 12, 13], [21, 22, 23])
            >>> sequencetools.zip_sequences(sequences)
            [(1, 11, 21), (2, 12, 22), (3, 13, 23)]

    Returns list.
