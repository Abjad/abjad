def transpose_pitch_number_by_octave_transposition_mapping(pitch_number, mapping):
    '''Transpose `pitch_number` by the some number of octaves up or down.
    Derive correct number of octaves from `mapping` where
    `mapping` is a list of ``(range_spec, octave)`` pairs
    and ``range_spec`` is, in turn, a ``(start, stop)`` pair
    suitable to pass to the built-in Python ``range()`` function:

    ::

        >>> mapping = [((-39, -13), 0), ((-12, 23), 12), ((24, 48), 24)]

    The mapping given here comprises three ``(range_spec, octave)`` pairs.
    The first such pair is ``((-39, -13), 0)`` and can be read as follows:
    "any pitches between ``-39`` and ``-13`` should be transposed into the
    octave rooted at pitch ``0``." The octave rooted at pitch ``0``
    equals the twelve pitches ``range(0, 0 + 12)`` or
    ``[0, 1, ..., 10, 11]``.

    The second ``(range_spec, octave)`` pair is ``((-12, 23), 12)`` and
    can be read as "any pitches between ``-12`` and ``23`` should be
    transposed into the octave rooted at pitch ``12``," with the octave
    rooted at pitch ``12`` equal to the twelve pitches
    ``range(12, 12 + 12)`` or ``[12, 13, ..., 22, 23]``.

    The third and last ``(range_spec, octave)`` pair is ``((24, 48), 24)``
    and can be read as "any pitches between ``24`` and ``48`` should
    be transposed to the octave rooted at ``24``," with the octave
    rooted at ``24`` equal to the twelve pitches ``range(24, 24, + 12)``
    or ``[24, 25, ..., 34, 35]``.

    The mapping given here divides
    the compass of the piano, from ``-39`` to ``48``, into three
    disjunct subranges and then explains how to transpose pitches
    found in any of those three disjunct subranges. This means that,
    for example, all the f-sharps within the range of the piano now
    undergo a known transposition under `mapping` as defined here:

    ::

        >>> pitchtools.transpose_pitch_number_by_octave_transposition_mapping(
        ...     -30, mapping)
        6

    We verify that pitch ``-30`` should map to pitch ``6`` by noticing
    that pitch ``-30`` falls in the first of the three subranges
    defined by `mapping` from ``-39`` to ``-13`` and then noting
    that `mapping` sends pitches with that subrange to the octave
    rooted at pitch ``0``. The octave transposition of ``-30`` that
    falls within the octave rooted at ``0`` is ``6``:

    ::

        >>> pitchtools.transpose_pitch_number_by_octave_transposition_mapping(
        ...     -18, mapping)
        6

    Likewise, `mapping` sends pitch ``-18`` to pitch ``6`` because
    pitch ``-18`` falls in the same subrange from ``-39`` to ``-13``
    as did pitch ``-39`` and so undergoes the same transposition to
    the octave rooted at ``0``.

    In this way we can map all f-sharps from ``-39`` to ``48`` according
    to `mapping`:

    ::

        >>> pitch_numbers = [-30, -18, -6, 6, 18, 30, 42]
        >>> for n in pitch_numbers:
        ...   n, pitchtools.transpose_pitch_number_by_octave_transposition_mapping(
        ...         n, mapping)
        ...
        (-30, 6)
        (-18, 6)
        (-6, 18)
        (6, 18)
        (18, 18)
        (30, 30)
        (42, 30)

    And so on.

    Returns pitch number.
