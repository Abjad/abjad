Abjad helps composers build up complex pieces of music notation in iterative and
incremental ways. Use Abjad to create symbolic representations of all the notes, rests,
chords, tuplets, voices, beams, slurs and much more in any score. Because Abjad extends
the Python programming language, you can use Abjad to make systematic changes to your
music as you work. And because Abjad wraps the LilyPond music notation package, you can
use Abjad to control the typographic details of the symbols on the page.
