Summer workshop
===============

Summers | Palo Alto, CA

https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/python-and-abjad-in-music-comp-2018

Hosted at Stanford's CCMRA, the course provides an introduction to the production of
professionally engraved musical scores using the Python programming language and the
Abjad API for Formalized Score Control as part of compositional practice.

The course introduces Abjad's object-oriented approach to music notation and algorithmic
composition through real-world examples and hands-on coding activities. No previous
programming experience is required. Python basics will be taught from the ground up
during the course with musical examples designed to make sense to composers.

Topics covered include:

* system installation and configuration
* defining your own functions, classes and modules
* generating structured tableaux of rhythms, pitch collections and other
  materials during precomposition
* managing polyphony with operations on voices, staves and other musical containers
* working with parametric score layout
* understanding the document structure of complex scores
* controlling the details of musical typography programmatically

Taught by Jeff Treviño, Trevor Bača and Joséphine Wolf Oberholtzer.
