{# This empty file exists to *overwrite* RTD's breadcrumbs.html file.
   The purpose is to remove RTD's breadcrumbs banner at the top of every page.
   Adapted from https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/remove-edit-buttons.html

{# If we ever set prev_next_buttons_location="both" then uncomment these instead:

    {%- extends "sphinx_rtd_theme/breadcrumbs.html" %}
    {% block breadcrumbs %}{% endblock %}
