Abjad helps composers build up complex pieces of music notation in an iterative
and incremental way. Use Abjad to create symbolic representations of all the
notes, rests, staves, tuplets, beams and slurs in any score. Because Abjad
extends the `Python`_ programming language, you can use Abjad to make
systematic changes to your music as you work. And because Abjad wraps the
powerful `LilyPond`_ music notation package, you can use Abjad to control the
typographic details of the symbols on the page.
