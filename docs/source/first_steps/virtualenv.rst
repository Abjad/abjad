Working with Python virtual environments
----------------------------------------

Managing different versions of Python on your system can be confusing. Your operating system probably came with a version of Python preinstalled. And chances are good that you will install a different version of Python sometime later. It's also likely that you will install (or already have installed) versions of both Python 2 and Python 3 on your computer, too.

This situation is not in itself a problem. But complexity arises in the management of the different **packages** you will invariably install while you work. Use ``pip`` to install Python's ``roman`` package for Roman numerals. Is ``roman`` installed for Python 2.7.8 (which came bundled with the most recent version of your operating system)?  Or for Python 2.7.16 (which you installed by hand)? Or for Python 3.7.4 (which you also sometimes use)? Which version of Python is ``pip`` working with? And how can you check? It usually works just to install a package and hope for the best. But what happens when you upgrade Python or the packages in your package library?

Enter Python virtual environments. Python virtual environments allow you to isolate the Python packages you install from the global collection(s) of Python packages preinstalled elsewhere on your computer. This can clean up your development environment significantly. And we recommend that all users of Abjad work in Python virtual environments. Especially if you intend to contribute to Abjad development by working on the Abjad codebase itself. Good summaries explaining how to work with Python virtual environments are available on the internet. But the process is easy enough to explain here, too. 

The `virtualenvurl`_ package provides tools for working with Python virtual environments. Almost everything you'll want to do with Python virtual environments can be done with the  `virtualenvwrapper`_ package. Install `virtualenvwrapper`_ like this:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~$ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

After installing ``virtualenvwrapper`` you have to decide where Python should store the files you create when working in a virtual environment. Any directory will work. We recommend ``~/.virtualenvs``. Decide which directory to use and then set the ``WORKON_HOME`` environment variable:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~$ export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
    ~$ mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME

Source the ``virtualenvwrapper.sh`` script. This script teaches your shell how to create, activate and delete virtual environments:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~$ source `which virtualenvwrapper.sh`

You can now create a virtual environment named ``abjad`` like this:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~$ mkvirtualenv abjad

The terminal prompt changes to show that you are now working in the ``abjad`` virtual environment you just created. Now you can install Python packages in the ``abjad`` virtual environment and be safe in the knowledge that packages you install won't interfere with Python packages installed anywhere else on your system. Here's how you install the Abjad package in your ``abjad`` virtual environment:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~(abjad)$ pip install abjad
    ...

When you are done working in a virtual environment you can exit the virtual environment to return to your default shell:

..  code-block:: bash

    ~(abjad)$ deactivate

Add these two lines to your ``~/.profile`` if you decide to use Python virtual environments every time you work in Abjad:

..  code-block:: bash

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    source `which virtualenvwrapper.sh`
