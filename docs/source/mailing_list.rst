Mailing list
============

The Abjad mailing list is hosted on Google Groups. The list moderated.
Follow the instructions on the Google Groups page to join:

Abjad encourages contributions, discussions and usage from all people
interested in music and computers. This encouragement extends to all people
regardless of (among other aspects) gender, race, sexual orientation,
disability, religion, appearance, veteran status, gender identity,
socioeconomic status or nationality.

Members of the community strive to be friendly, patient and welcoming,
especially of viewpoints and experiences different from our own. We reject
harassment and contributions (in mail, comments or code) that belittle
individuals or groups of people.

We ask all members of the community to be mindful particularly about
assumptions of the gender of users (choice of pronouns in comments and code).
We recognize that members sometimes make mistakes and will, in general, accept
sincere regrets for such cases. Blatant or repeated violations of the code will
result in the removal of the contributorâ€™s participation in the community.

The maintainers of Abjad and associated sites commit themselves to enforcing
this code of conduct. Users who notice violations, including instances of
abuse, harassment or otherwise unacceptable behavior are requested to contact
trevor.baca@gmail.com. Maintainers will always respect confidentiality with
regards to reports.

We gratefully acknowledge the example of our friends at `music21
<https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21>`_ from whom the source of this text is
taken.
