Abjad encourages contributions, discussions and usage from all people interested in music
and computers. This encouragement extends to all people regardless of gender, race,
sexual orientation, disability, religion, appearance, veteran status, gender identity,
socioeconomic status or nationality. Members of the community strive to be friendly,
patient and welcoming, especially of viewpoints and experiences different from our own.
We reject harassment and contributions that belittle individuals or groups of people. We
ask all members of the community to be mindful particularly about assumptions of the
gender of users. Violations of this code will result in users being asked to apologize;
repeated violations may result in users being asked to leave the community. Please
contact trevor.baca@gmail.com if you notice problems that should be corrected.
Confidentiality will always be respected. We are proud of the overwhelming positivity and
helpfulness of Abjad users, developers and contributors everywhere. And we gratefully
acknowledge the example of our friends at `music21
<https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21>`_ from whom this text was adapted.
