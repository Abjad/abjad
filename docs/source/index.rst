Abjad |release|
===============

..  include:: abstract.txt

Quickstart
----------

Get Abjad via `pip`_::

    ~$ pip install abjad

Then get `LilyPond`_ from http://lilypond.org/development.html. Read the
:ref:`installation instructions<installation>` for help installing Abjad and dependencies
like `LilyPond`_.

    installation

Start Python and import Abjad:

::

    >>> import abjad

Then make some notes:

::

    >>> duration = abjad.Duration(1, 4)
    >>> notes = [abjad.Note(pitch, duration) for pitch in range(8)]
    >>> staff = abjad.Staff(notes)
    >>> abjad.show(staff)

Split these notes at every 5/16 of a whole note. Transpose every other group up a
major-seventh. Then slur and accent each group:

::

    >>> groups = abjad.mutate.split(
    ...     staff[:],
    ...     durations=[abjad.Duration(5, 16)],
    ...     cyclic=True,
    ... )
    >>> for index, group in enumerate(groups):
    ...     if index % 2:
    ...         abjad.mutate.transpose(group, "M7")
    ...     if 1 < len(group):
    ...         abjad.slur(group)
    ...     accent = abjad.Articulation("accent")
    ...     abjad.attach(accent, group[0])
    ...
    >>> abjad.show(staff)

Then create a second staff and invert its pitches:

::

    >>> copied_staff = abjad.mutate.copy(staff)
    >>> staff_group = abjad.StaffGroup(
    ...     [staff, copied_staff],
    ...     lilypond_type="PianoStaff",
    ... )
    >>> for note in abjad.select(copied_staff).notes():
    ...     note.written_pitch = note.written_pitch.invert(axis="G4")
    ... 
    >>> abjad.show(staff_group)

Notice that the music notation examples in Abjad's docs are styled in a special way:
notes, chords and rests are spaced proportionally; there are no bar numbers; tuplet
numbers are cleaned up; and so on. These settings differ somewhat from LilyPond defaults.

Features
--------

Abjad 3.1 implements an extensive collection of tools for score formalization. Among its
core features, Abjad lets you:

-   Model compositional thinking computationally.
-   Create music notation in an object-oriented way.
-   Select musical objects programmatically.
-   Control the typographic details of music notation.
-   Parse LilyPond and RTM syntax into Abjad objects.
-   Create and transform complex rhythms.

`CCRMA Summer Workshop`_ 
````````````````````````
Summers | Palo Alto, CA

Introduction to the production of professionally engraved musical scores using the Python
programming language and the Abjad API for Formalized Score Control as part of
compositional practice.

The course introduces Abjad's object-oriented approach to music notation and algorithmic
composition through real-world examples and hands-on coding activities. No previous
programming experience is required. Python basics will be taught from the ground up
during the course with musical examples designed to make sense to composers.

Topics covered include:

-   system installation and configuration
-   defining your own functions, classes and modules
-   generating structured tableaux of rhythms, pitch collections and other
    materials during precomposition
-   managing polyphony with operations on voices, staves and other musical containers
-   working with parametric score layout
-   understanding the document structure of complex scores
-   controlling the details of musical typography programmatically

Taught by Jeff Treviño, Trevor Bača and Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer.

Visit the `CCRMA`_ website for the most up-to-date scheduling information about
this annual course.

The Abjad package ecosystem includes tools for rhythmic quantization and
rhythmic construction:

Happy composing and welcome to Abjad!

..  rubric:: Footnotes

..  [#f1] LilyPond examples in Abjad's docs are generated via a custom
          `Sphinx`_ extension housed in the :py:mod:`abjad.ext.sphinx
          <abjad.ext.sphinx>` subpackage. A default :download:`stylesheet
          <_stylesheets/default.ily>` is included in each generated file. But
          not all excerpts are styled the same: examples demonstrating
          `LilyPond`_ overrides include a non-default stylesheet, for example.
          ``\include "..."`` statements in Abjad examples reference files in
          the ``abjad/docs/source/_stylesheets/`` directory.
